Are you sure? In a <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0045457?imageURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0045457.t001">study</a> published in PLoS ONE, Swedish researchers got 160 survey respondents to report their positions on a variety of morally sticky concepts -- and then got the majority of them to change their minds without even realizing it.</p> <p>The video shows how they pulled off the trick, the gist of it being that the original statements that the participants rated their agreement or disagreement with were surreptitiously reversed. So when participants returned to their responses, it now appeared that they were agreeing or disagreeing with the direct opposite of what they had originally seen.&nbsp; And <i>voila --</i> those who found Israeli violence against Hamas morally reprehensible were suddenly supporting it.<br></p><p>These switches went unnoticed 69 percent of the time. This video doesn't show subjects arguing vehemently in favor of moral issues that they had just claimed to oppose, but 53 percent ending up doing just that, including the most polarized of respondents.</p> <p>The positive takeaway is that people are more open-minded than we generally give them credit for. The more pessimistic way of looking at it is that we aren't all that principled, and the conceptions of morality upon which society is built are actually a huge sham. If nothing else, it definitely calls to question the utility of surveys being able to tell us anything about what people actually think.</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625830/s/23ae9a41/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=We%27re+More+Open-Minded+Than+We+Think&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fwere-more-open-minded-than-we-think%2F262681%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=We%27re+More+Open-Minded+Than+We+Think&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fwere-more-open-minded-than-we-think%2F262681%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540661015/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ae9a41/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540661015/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ae9a41/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144540661015/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ae9a41/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~4/SxhvLAXGNlU" height="1" width="1"></div><div class='chunk'>Health : The Atlantic<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~3/qLnyM6AE3UU/story01.htm>Decorating for the Afterlife: The Modern American Mausoleum</a><p><i>"The peculiar mix of modernism and death reflects the things most kitsch, troubling, and beautiful about our modern culture."</i></p> <div><div align="center"><a href="http://flavorwire.com/"><img alt="flavorpillheader.PNG" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/culture_test/flavorpillheader.PNG" width="227" height="52"></a></div> <p> <span><a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/330128/10-of-the-creepiest-ghosts-in-literature"><b>The Creepiest Ghosts in Literature</b></a></span><br><span><a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/329019/abandoned-spaces-reclaimed-by-art"><b>Abandoned Spaces Reclaimed by Art</b></a></span><br><span><a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/326340/tv-sitcoms-most-boundary-breaking-families"><b>TV Sitcoms' Most Boundary-Breaking Families</b></a></span><br></p><hr></div> <p> In the 1950s, a fashion for interring the deceased in luxurious marble mausoleums (as opposed to burial plots) took hold -- as far as fashions for the dead can take hold, we mean. After taking a tour of one such facility, Chicago-based photographer <a href="http://www.johnfaier.com/">John Faier</a>&nbsp;was hooked, and spent six years photographing mausoleums from the time period all over the country. We spotted his resultant photo series,<em> <a href="http://www.johnfaier.com/personal_work.htm" target="_blank">Queen of Heaven</a></em>, over at <a href="http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2012/09/mausoleums-john-faier/" target="_blank">Raw File</a>. The mausoleums have an ominous, almost surreal feeling, like the chapel in the Overlook Hotel as photographed by David Lynch, both lavish and somehow hollow-feeling. "Bright colors, matching upholstery, matching lamp shades -- the architecture reminds us more of a cocktail lounger or hotel, not of a mausoleum," Faier muses. "The peculiar mix of modernism and death reflects the things most kitsch, troubling, and beautiful about our modern culture." Even more peculiar? Over six years of shooting, he says, he never ran into a mourner. </p><p></p> <img alt="ma11.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma11.jpg" width="600" height="450"><img alt="ma6.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma6.jpg" width="600" height="480"><img alt="ma8.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma8.jpg" width="600" height="480"><img alt="ma5.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma5.jpg" width="600" height="600"><img alt="ma9.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma9.jpg" width="600" height="600"><img alt="ma7.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma7.jpg" width="600" height="480"><img alt="ma.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma.jpg" width="600" height="600"><img alt="ma2.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma2.jpg" width="600" height="480"><img alt="ma3.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma3.jpg" width="600" height="600"><img alt="ma4.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma4.jpg" width="600" height="600"><div><em><small>Photos courtesy of <a href="http://www.johnfaier.com/">John Faier</a></small> </em></div><div><em><small><br></small></em></div><hr><em>This post also appears on <a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/330230/the-eerie-beauty-of-american-mausoleums?all=1">Flavorpill</a>, an </em>Atlantic<em> partner site. </em><p></p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625830/s/23ada88f/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Decorating+for+the+Afterlife%3A+The+Modern+American+Mausoleum&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fdecorating-for-the-afterlife-the-modern-american-mausoleum%2F262669%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Decorating+for+the+Afterlife%3A+The+Modern+American+Mausoleum&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fdecorating-for-the-afterlife-the-modern-american-mausoleum%2F262669%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145605771873/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ada88f/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145605771873/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ada88f/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145605771873/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ada88f/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~4/qLnyM6AE3UU" height="1" width="1"></div><div class='chunk'>Health : The Atlantic<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~3/G4D_9avq4As/story01.htm>The Therapeutic Experience of Being Suspended by Your Skin</a><p><i>The 5,000 year history of the "art" comes down to physics, spirituality, and risk.</i></p> <p><img alt="bodysuspensionmain3ap.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/bodysuspensionmain3ap45.jpg" width="615" height="300"></p><div>A man suspended in Lviv, Ukraine [Pavlo Palamarchuk/AP]</div> <p></p> <p> A woman lies face down on a massage table. She is tended to by five men wearing surgical masks and gloves. The men aren't wearing scrubs, though, and elaborate tattoos are visible on three of the men's arms. They insert large fishhooks under the woman's skin: in her calves, thighs, and lower, middle, and upper back. They work quickly and with practiced efficiency, grabbing a good sized piece of skin, pushing the hook into the skin until -- pop -- it slides in and out the other side. There is no blood. The men position the hook's bend around the freshly pierced hunk of flesh before moving onto another piercing. </p> <p> The woman goes by the name Trigger. She posted a video montage of several of her body suspensions -- a form of body modification that involves hanging a human body by hooks attached to ropes -- to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvQ57R0IoI4">YouTube</a>. In her video description, in an attempt to ward off hurtful comments from both the prejudiced and the Internet's resident ignoramuses, she wrote: </p> <blockquote> <p> This is a little music video I made to footage of some of my suspensions. Some were hard and painful, some were fun &amp; painful. Either way, I'm always grateful for the opportunities I had to do these suspensions and will never forget what an impact they have had and continue having on my life. </p> <p> Enjoy this video, but please, no comments about how gross this is... if you don't understand it or agree with it, that's perfectly okay, but there is no need for disrespectful comments. </p> </blockquote> <p> The rest of the video, after the piercings, shows Trigger suspended. She hangs in a number of positions: from hooks inserted into her upper back, known as a suicide suspension because the suspended person appears to have hanged him or herself; from the skin around her knees; and face down from hooks that run the length of her back and legs in what is called a Superman suspension. A suspension artist, who is responsible for setting up the hooks, ropes, and pulleys for the suspension, monitors the entire process. During some of Trigger's suspensions, a man hugs her tenderly and strokes her hair, rocking her body gently back and forth in the air. For the Superman suspension, she remains in a resting position. During one of her two suicide suspensions, she swings back and forth in a wide arc. </p> <p> "Really beautiful, thanks for sharing," one commenter wrote. </p> <blockquote>Tearing of the skin can, and does, happen, but it's almost never the sort of dramatic freefall that someone watching a suspension for the first time might imagine.</blockquote> <p> "Hey, just wanted to let you know that I am finally going up!" wrote another. "Thank you for giving me the inspiration to do this. I have a 4 pt knee scheduled for tomorrow!" </p> <p> One simply asked, "Why?" </p><p>***</p> <p> People have been hanging themselves from hooks for roughly 5,000 years. Perhaps the most ancient suspensions occurred in India, where suspension was a sort of religious penance. Devotees at the ancient Hindu festival Thaipusam, which continues to this day throughout Southeast Asia and is popular among Tamils, suspend themselves in a practice called <em>vel kavadi</em>. Those who perform the <em>vel kavadi </em>pierce their flesh with hooks and skewers -- stand-ins for the spear that Shiva's wife, Parvati, gave to the god of war Murugan to kill the demon Soorapadam -- as an expression of debt bondage and devotion to Murugan. The pierced worshippers often attach ropes to their hooks, which are pulled by other devotees or used to suspend the worshippers in the air. The level of pain the suspended feels correlates with the level of devotion--the more pain, the more sincere the worship. Suspensions also occur at the Chidi Mari festival, another Tamil holiday. </p> <p> Half a world away, on the banks of the Missouri River, the Mandan tribe suspended young warriors in an annual rite of passage ceremony that celebrated the creation of the earth. The Okipa ceremony, as it was called, required initiates to fast and hold vigil for four days, then dance, and lastly perform trials of endurance. The warriors-to-be had to prove their strength to their elders and the spirits. The young men were suspended from the roof of the tribe's lodge by ropes attached to skewers in their chest, back or shoulders. To increase the pain, weights were attached to their legs. Cries of agony were considered cowardly. The warriors would faint and were brought down to be watched over by the men who presided over the ceremony. When an initiate woke up, it signified the spirits' approval.&nbsp;</p><p>The new initiates then had their left pinky removed with a hatchet, and finished the ceremony by racing around the village in a race called "the last race." The skewers were still in place, the weights still attached. The Okipa ceremony was first documented by an outsider around 1835 when George Catlin, an American painter on an expedition with William Clark, produced a painting of the ceremony. The last Okipa ceremony took place in 1889. A variation of the Okipa ceremony was made famous in the 1973 film <em>A Man Called Horse </em>when Richard Harris' character underwent a similar ceremony in order to gain acceptance from the Lakota tribe that had taken him prisoner. </p> <p> Though many people who practice suspension see it as a spiritual experience and a way to test themselves, most suspensions today are not performed as religious sacraments or trials of endurance. For some, it's a sort of, "If I can do this, I can do anything," attitude. For others, it is akin to meditation.&nbsp;</p><p>Modern suspension has been largely shaped by Fakir Musafar, a man who was born on an Indian reservation in South Dakota with the name Roland Loomis and developed, or brought back, many types of suspension. Musafar performed the Okipa suspension in 1966 and also coined the term "modern primitives" to describe a subculture that practices body modification with a particular interest in rite of passage rituals. For Musafar, and many others after him, body modification is a form of self-expression and spiritual exploration, a way to move beyond the body into a higher spiritual plane. But others who practice suspension today distance themselves from the sort of ritualistic elements espoused by Musafar, and instead choose to hang for the sake of hanging. </p><p>***</p><p><br></p> <p> </p><blockquote>"And this was just the ultimate stress release. Everything bad that had built up, it was just resetting it back to zero."</blockquote> <p></p> <p>Cere Coichetti is the head of the New York chapter of Rites of Passage, a group that facilitates suspensions up and down the east coast. He first was introduced to suspension twelve years ago through his friend Brian, a body modification artist in New York. Brian had a friend, Emrys, who had recently moved to New York from Boston and who practiced suspension, something that Coichetti, though active in the body modification scene, hadn't heard of. Suspension requires a small team of helpers to set up and monitor the suspension, and Emrys enlisted Coichetti and Brian to help him suspend. Within a week or so, Coichetti tried his first suspension -- a Superman. </p> <div> <img alt="SHARK300200.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/suspension200300bw.jpg" width="200" height="300">A Superman at a suspension conference in Tel Aviv. [AmirCohen/Reuters]</div> <p> "I wanted to see if I was tough enough to do it," Coichetti said with a smile as we talked over meatball sliders at a restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. "It came down to a challenge to myself, a test of strength. If I can put hooks in my body -- suspend my near 300-pound frame from little hooks -- then there's nothing I couldn't do. I thought it was going to hurt. I thought it was going to suck. I thought it was going to be the most traumatizing experience of my life." </p> <p> Coichetti's body is covered in tattoos, and his head, shaved bald, is adorned with a neatly trimmed goatee. In his ears, for aesthetic reasons, he has removed the cartilage around the ear canal in what is known as a conch removal. It's possible to see through the little holes in his ears, but you wouldn't even notice the modification unless you sat down and talked with him. He is lively and expressive, and as he told me about his first suspension, he did a good deal of speaking with his hands. </p> <p> "So, I go in and I'm ready to go through it," he said, "and once I got into the air, once they lifted me up, it was the most peaceful, serene, blissful experience I've ever had. And it was kind of like, throughout life, you tend to take on negative energy -- by energy I could mean stress -- stress from your job, stress from home, if you're married, if you've got kids -- just stress. And this was just the ultimate stress release. Everything bad that had built up, it was just resetting it back to zero."</p> <p> "The second I came down, I knew I wanted to go back up." </p> <p> Shortly after his first suspension, Coichetti began to study the rigging aspects of suspension. He consulted Allen Falkner, one of Fakir Musafar's apprentices and also one of the greatest influences on suspension as a non-ritualistic act, to learn about suspension techniques. </p> <p> Coichetti says that he has helped people from all walks of life suspend, including lawyers, wrestlers, doctors, acrobats and politicians. Two of Trigger's suspensions in her YouTube video were done by Rites of Passage. The group performs suspensions free of charge, but ask for a suggested donation to cover the cost of hooks and other equipment. Any money Rites of Passage receives in excess of the suggested donation goes to sending the group's members to certification courses in first aid and industrial rigging. </p> <p> "Suspension can be broken into two aspects," Coichetti said, "basically the medical aspect and the rigging aspect. By medical, I mean the insertion of the hooks, the cleaning, the blood, the skin, how that all works. The hard part about suspension has nothing to do with the body. It's everything above the hooks." </p> <p> The rigging methods of suspension are borrowed from techniques developed for construction, rock climbing, and stage rigging (think Cirque de Soleil). Those who master the rigging techniques are referred to as suspension artists. </p> <p> "The term <i>suspension artist </i>is a bit misleading," Coichetti said. Suspension is, he insisted, a skill. "It's not really an art. Anyone can learn to be a suspension artist. It's science. It's math. It's understanding principles and practicing and putting those principles into effect. </p> <p> "When we go up to install rigging points, we need to know what the ceiling is made of, how it's constructed, what it can support. I need to know what it's already supporting on top of it. If I'm stressing a ceiling at a fracture point where they have an air compression unit on top of it, I need to know that." </p> <p> The rest, Coichetti said, is all physics, and it boils down to F=MA. </p> <p> "When I have a pulley system on a ceiling, if you weigh 100 pounds, I have to exert 100 pounds to lift you off the ground," he said. "Now, you also have motion. You have to figure out the angle of motion, the rate of acceleration. I do it in my head. I have to figure out how much stress you are putting on the top rig, on the pulley, on the rope, on your hooks, on yourself, and I have to make sure everything is within a correct range." </p> <p> To more easily hoist the weight of a human body, suspension artists make use of mechanical advantage, rigging up complex pulley systems that facilitate the raising and lowering of the suspended person. Coichetti once rigged a woman in a marionette suspension, where hooks were inserted on the woman's back, into her legs, and into her arms, so that the woman was suspended as a living, breathing marionette controlled by Coichetti with the movement of his hand and arm. </p> <p> "I had to figure out a way to attach all her points to a glove," Coichetti said. "So that going like this," he moved two fingers up and down as if playing a piano, "would raise her left arm, would raise her right arm. And I had to rig it all so that just three inches of motion would create four feet of motion on her side." Moving his arm up and down lowered and raised the woman. </p> <p> He acknowledged, though, that he had a little help with lifting the woman's limbs with his fingers--most people, he said, when they feel a hook pulling on their arm tend to raise their arm along with the upward pull. </p><p>***</p> <p> The most visibly jarring thing about watching a suspension is seeing flesh stretch as it supports the weight of the body. It looks like it's about to rip -- sending the suspended person falling to the ground amidst a confetti of torn flesh and blood -- but it's actually quite safe. During a suspension, hooks are inserted under the dermis and into the subcutaneous fatty tissue, a very resilient chunk of flesh. </p> <p> "Skin is pretty strong," Dr. Nelson Goldberg, a plastic surgeon at the University of Maryland Medical Center, said. "It's basically leather, and in the back it's basically double leather. I think it could easily handle the tension before it would rip." </p> <p> Dr. Brett King, an assistant professor of dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine, sees suspension as an application of physics and a testament to the human body's remarkable toughness and healing ability. </p> <div> <img alt="SHARK300200.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/RTR2OPDY300200susp.jpg" width="300" height="200">[AmirCohen/Reuters]</div> <p> "You're putting your body's weight worth of force across that tissue," King said, "and it's quite striking that the skin holds up as well as it does. My guess is that, whether or not the practitioners of suspension realize it or not, the people who plant the hooks in the skin understand that there's a tremendous amount of physics to all of this. They must use hooks that are appropriately thick to hook an appropriately broad swath of skin. You can imagine, if you were to take something as thin as a slim nail and kind of loop it under the skin and back out, and then pull the two ends away from the body, it might very well rip the skin. Alternatively, if a much wider nail or hook is sewn underneath and back out across a wide enough section of skin, then suddenly there is enough fabric to support the weight. It's a calculation that involves the total dimension of skin across which you're supporting some amount of weight." </p> <p> "It's kind of dazzling," he said, "to conceive the entire body's weight being supported by a couple of hooks through the chest." </p> <p> "It's pretty cool," he added. </p> <p> When I asked Coichetti to describe the sensation of being suspended, he said, "It's this odd pressure, and it almost feels like--" he paused, thinking. "Do you ever stand in the sunlight, like at the beach, and, not that it hurts, but you can feel when you're burning? Like, 'Aw, man, I can feel the heat. I can feel myself burning. I know I've gotta get out of the sunlight.' That burning sensation. You feel that. It's not painful, but you definitely feel burning. And you feel this odd pressure happening. Once you're in the air for, like, 30 or 40 seconds, that burn fades away. And then you get hit with the euphoria. You still feel the pressure, but at that point in time, you're elsewhere." </p> <p> "Grab the meat of our best friend's back and just yank up really hard," AJ Karras suggested. "Try to pick them up, too." </p> <p> Karras, a young woman with pink hair, came to New York City from outside Amherst, Massachusetts, to be suspended for the first time by Coichetti. She was excited, and her boyfriend had come with her for his first suspension, too. Karras has been involved in the body modification scene for about five years, and has been helping out with suspensions and heavier body modifications, mostly types of cosmetic implants, for the last two. </p> <p> "I saw suspension videos when I was 15 years old," she said, "and I was like, 'Dude, I have to try that. I just have to.' I just always knew that it was part of me." </p> <p> I asked her what types of suspension she was interested in trying. </p> <p> "All of them," she said without hesitation. "Eventually. Gotta let my body heal up between, but eventually I want to try as many different and new things as we can think of." </p> <p> Tearing of the skin can, and does, happen, but it's almost never the sort of dramatic freefall that someone watching a suspension for the first time might imagine. There are certain parts of the body, like the knees and the chest, where tearing is more likely to occur. Tearing happens slowly, and there is more than enough time, Coichetti said, to get the suspended person down on the ground before there is any serious injury. Skilled suspension artists can tell when the skin is beginning to tear, and will inform the suspended person what is going on. </p> <blockquote>Coichetti's biggest concern about suspension is that people will try to imitate what they see on the Internet without the proper medical and technical knowledge required to perform a safe suspension.</blockquote> <p> "When someone is in the air and they're swinging around," Coichetti said, "and I see that tearing has begun, I'll stop them and be like, 'Your skin is beginning to tear. It's not an issue right now, but in about a minute or two it's going to get to the point where you need a stitch or two. Are you comfortable with that?' If someone's in danger of the skin completely opening, we bring them down. They don't have a choice. But if you're suspending and you're at this moment, most people go, 'Leave me up here, suture me later.'" </p> <p> You can find examples of suspensions gone wrong on the Internet. At a certain point, skin gives out, as King said. In most cases when a suspended person falls, though, the fall isn't due to the skin actually ripping. Improper insertion of the hooks, in conjunction with a high degree of motion, can result in the hooks sliding out. Professionals who are attempting suspensions at great heights or suspensions that involve a good deal of motion will rig up a safety harness that acts as a failsafe should the hooks come out for some reason.&nbsp;</p><p>One video on Hook Life, a blog that caters to the suspension community, shows a Russian suspension team suspending a man in an abandoned warehouse. The man freefalls from a great height, then swings back and forth. He is harnessed in. Hook Life, though, added a lengthy disclaimer before posting the video, warning readers, essentially, not to try this at home. Coichetti's biggest concern about suspension is that people will try to imitate what they see on the Internet without the proper medical and technical knowledge required to perform a safe suspension. </p> <p> Both King and Goldberg considered infection to be the greatest risk during suspension, but knowledgeable suspension artists use sterilized hooks, needles, and gauze when suspending someone to minimize the risk. Some scarring is inevitable, but when Coichetti showed me a point on his leg where he had suspended seven times, I wouldn't have noticed anything if it weren't for a white spot in a tattoo, evidence of where hooks had been. There is, as King suggested, a high level of physics and medical knowledge being put to use during a suspension, and Coichetti says safety is his number one priority. He is a certified first responder, meaning he is trained in providing pre-hospital care for medical emergencies, and a volunteer fire fighter. Most of his team are certified in first aid care, and two of the suspension artists in the Rites of Passage Boston chapter are paramedics. If someone has a medical condition that would complicate a suspension, he consults the person's doctor to clear him or her for suspension. He has turned some people looking to suspend away due to the medical risks that a condition presents. </p> <p> "It's up to the individual to figure out if the harm involved -- which, realistically is very minimal -- is worth what they get out of it," Coichetti said. "And the answer for suspenders is yes. Shock can be life threatening, but, I mean, you break your leg, you go into shock. Shock is on a spectrum," he made a wide space with his two hands, "we're just fucking around in this range," he said, using two fingers to indicate the very low end. And, he says, if something ever were to go wrong, the first thing he would do would be to call an ambulance. </p> <p> That feeling of shock is what many who suspend are looking for -- the rush of endorphins, serotonin, and other chemicals that results in a sort of high. Some see it as a spiritual experience. Others find it exhilarating, and laugh while they are suspended. A subset of those who practice suspension do it as a type of performance art, choreographing lurid and shocking spectacles that are performed in front of audiences. </p> <p> "A performance is there to shock the hell out of you," Coichetti said. "They're going to scream, they're going to make it look like it's the most bloody, painful, awful thing in the world. And it's all an act to get a visceral reaction out of the audience." </p> <p> Performance suspensions, Coichetti said, with their focus on shock value, can cheapen the type of suspension that he practices, which focuses more on creating a unique experience tailored to the suspended person. </p> <p> "I feel like it puts out the wrong public perception about what we do," he said. </p> <p> <strong></strong> </p> <p> "Spirituality is very important to me," Coichetti said. But, he clarified, "I'm very technical. I look at, when I'm doing a suspension or any kind of ritual, what physically is going on. I want to know what's causing this euphoria. We're in a world nowadays where I don't have to go, 'Oh, the state of euphoria is caused by this god raining down on me.' This state of euphoria is caused by <em>these</em> certain chemicals being released because of <em>these</em> physical triggers. I will absolutely suspend you and have a drum circle going on, beating on drums and chanting; not because I'm a hippy, but because I know steady bass rhythms allow your brain to function at a theta level and it allows you to trance easier."</p> <p> "Now, even though I'm very technical and I want to get into the chemistry of this, it's still a spiritual experience. Is it spiritual to a god? To the world? To myself? I don't know, I'll figure that out one day," he said with a smile. "All I know is that my end result, regardless of how I get there, is a feeling of complete freedom." </p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625830/s/23acd65f/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=The+Therapeutic+Experience+of+Being+Suspended+by+Your+Skin&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fthe-therapeutic-experience-of-being-suspended-by-your-skin%2F262644%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=The+Therapeutic+Experience+of+Being+Suspended+by+Your+Skin&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fthe-therapeutic-experience-of-being-suspended-by-your-skin%2F262644%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608326434/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23acd65f/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608326434/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23acd65f/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608326434/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23acd65f/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~4/G4D_9avq4As" height="1" width="1"></div><div class='chunk'>Health : The Atlantic<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~3/VSteUjkBwoU/story01.htm>Study: Oxytocin ('The Hormone of Love') Also Makes Us Conformists</a><p> <em>You think your tastes are your own, but it may actually be that a hormone is making members of a groups share the same preferences.</em> </p> <img alt="sheepmain.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/sheepmain.jpg" height="230" width="615"><span>Rambling Traveler/Flickr</span> <p> <strong>PROBLEM: </strong> Oxytocin, which you may also know as "the hormone of love," is the <a href="http://io9.com/5925206/10-reasons-why-oxytocin-is-the-most-amazing-molecule-in-the-world">driving force</a> behind sociability, trust, and generosity. It enables everything from mother-child bonding to orgasms, and it's one of the main things that sociopaths lack. The catch is that it strictly promotes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/science/11hormone.html">in-group love</a> -- and so it can't be used to kumbaya away cultural and political conflicts.

But for the sake of standardization (and because you can't fake a hug), researchers administered the hormone via nasal spray to 34 subjects and a placebo to 35 others. The men participated in unrelated busywork until the oxytocin kicked in, at which point they were asked to rate symbols on an attractiveness scale of 1 to 11. ("<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbVKWCpNFhY">These go to eleven.</a>")&nbsp;</p><p>As they did so, they were shown everyone else's responses, including those of the other members of their randomly-determined "group." To ensure that people weren't trying to win social favor by agreeing with others in their group, the participants were not aware of one another's identities. </p> <p> <strong>RESULTS: </strong> Barring the chance that some of the symbols were inherently more attractive than others, the subjects demonstrated a general tendency to conform to other people's opinions: oxytocin or not, they gave significantly higher ratings to symbols that other participants also liked, and vice-versa. But in cases where one's group liked a symbol and "outsiders" didn't, the subjects doped with oxytocin trended toward their group members' ratings. This held regardless of how many favorable or disfavorable opinions they saw before passing their own judgment and was not observed in the placebo group. </p> <p> <strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Oxytocin stimulates in-group conformity -- to the extent that subjective preference is influenced by horde mentality. <br></p> <p> <strong>IMPLICATIONS: </strong> Oxytocin's effects were context-dependent, only causing conformity when the in-group's opinion was opposed to the out-group's. It may be that the hormone promotes in-group identification through shared biases, suggest the authors, ultimately functioning in the same way that team uniforms or gang colors do "to signal group membership and establish intergroup differentiation." </p> <p> <em> The full study, "<a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/09/18/0956797612446026.abstract?rss=1">The Herding Hormone; Oxytocin Stimulates In-Group Conformity</a>," </em> <em>will be published in the journal </em><a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/"> Psychological Science</a>.<em> </em> </p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625830/s/23ab511d/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Study%3A+Oxytocin+%28%27The+Hormone+of+Love%27%29+Also+Makes+Us+Conformists&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fstudy-oxytocin-the-hormone-of-love-also-makes-us-conformists%2F262637%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Study%3A+Oxytocin+%28%27The+Hormone+of+Love%27%29+Also+Makes+Us+Conformists&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fstudy-oxytocin-the-hormone-of-love-also-makes-us-conformists%2F262637%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608321447/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ab511d/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608321447/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ab511d/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608321447/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ab511d/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~4/VSteUjkBwoU" height="1" width="1"></div>

<p>While perusing Weekend Carnival, we came across a post that featured the blog owner&rsquo;s new <a href="http://weekdaycarnival.blogspot.com/2012/09/new-carpet-from-fleamarket.html" target="_blank">flea market rug find</a>, paired with some simple Scandinavian furniture and crisp white elements. The color palette is punchy and powerful, and the rug&rsquo;s subtle pattern goes well with the complicated wicker pattern of the chair.</p>

<p>While shooting the home of Lindsay Nakashima (grand niece of George Nakashima) for an upcoming <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/" target="_blank">Apartment Therapy</a> house tour, we noticed a fun texture combo there, too: an Oriental rug, mixing with wood floors, mixing with a faux fur throw, over a herringbone-patterned blanket with the blue felt of that bed.</p>

<p>Been wanting to add some drama and darkness into your home but didn&rsquo;t know how? It&rsquo;s not crazy modern but&nbsp;the <a href="http://lasociete.ca/index.html" target="_blank">La Societe Bistro</a> in Toronto, Canada has a certain je ne sais quoi, with lots of elements just begging to be borrowed (or outright stolen) for a kitchen, living room or heck even bedroom in a modern home. &ldquo;A marriage of Canada&rsquo;s most cosmopolitan city and Parisian bistro style and cuisine, La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; is a dining destination unlike any other in Toronto. Gloriously appointed with luxurious furnishings and a breathtaking stained-glass ceiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steal the dark color palette of this space. Or perhaps those great light fixtures. Or even the slightly Art Nouveau elements. If you dig the metalwork of this space, you should thank&nbsp;<a href="http://bastillemetalworks.com/" target="_blank">Bastille Metal Works</a>, an architectural metal design company that specializes in custom metal furnishings for commercial and residential locations. &nbsp;The process they use is &nbsp;&ldquo;slip-casting,&rdquo; a technique that fuses metals.

<p><strong>Staircases are one of the oldest structures in the history of architecture. </strong> Some have a practical purpose and some are works of art, but all of them can take you to a higher level- in terms of both elevation and fitness.  &ldquo;The Harvard Alumni Study found that men who average at least eight flights a day enjoy a <a href="http://consults.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/stairs-as-fitness-tool/">33 percent lower mortality</a> rate than men who are sedentary &mdash; and that&rsquo;s even better than the 22 percent lower death rate men earned by walking 1.3 miles a day.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s amazing how much money the fitness industry has made off of new equipment when most people have had free access to this effective tool since the beginning of civilization!  <span></span></p>

If you like a pic, be sure to click on the link and show the Instagrammer some love. Our theme for next week will be farms, so get out your overalls, roll around with some barnyard pals, and snap some pics while you&rsquo;re at it! If you&rsquo;d like to see your picture featured here next week, upload it to Instagram and tag it #farm @visualnews. Have a wonderful weekend and thanks for reading. </p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not the first thing you think of when you see a package of plastic cups, but Tara Donavan has been making beautiful sculptures with the mass produced items&hellip; and they look a lot like fields of snow.</strong> By taking transparent plastic cups and stacking them at varying heights, then placing them side-by-side, she makes a rolling field of white. It looks almost soft enough to make a snow angel.<span></span></p>

<p>Donovan&rsquo;s works use products like Scotch tape, styrofoam cups and drinking straws to create sculptural works with a biomorphic style. Because of their mostly brilliant white color, the shapes take on an inviting and clean feeling often resembling snow or soap bubbles. While the works have a very natural look to them, Donovan has this to say: &ldquo;It is not like I&rsquo;m trying to simulate nature. It&rsquo;s more of a mimicking of the way of nature, the way things actually grow.&rdquo; Thus by following the patterns found in the natural world, her works automatically embody the look and feel of it.

<p><strong>On March 11, 2011 Japan endured a tsunami and earthquake that brought disaster to the Fukushima region of the country.</strong> In its rage, it also brought the hazard of the crippled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant">Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant</a>. Initially listed as a level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, it became a level 7, the highest any nuclear disaster could attain. It joins <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster">Chernobyl</a> as the second nuclear disaster to reach such high levels.<span></span></p>
<p>Fukushima and Japan are still in great need of international assistance. It is not only a problem for the Japanese people, it is a problem for the world as nuclear contamination affects our oceans, wildlife, the agriculture of Japan and ultimately the health of the world population and our children.</p>
<p>Famous Osaka based artist <a href="http://www.kenhamazaki.jp/e/profile.htm">Ken Hamakazi</a> decided to raise awareness and consciousness to the issue at hand through his special &ldquo;<em>Red Tea Ceremony</em>.&rdquo; In the ceremony, a visitor will take off their shoes and kneel on a soft pillow facing Ken, who commences the honored ritual that has been part of Japanese culture for thousands of years. A simple pastry is provided in a little red box, which the participant eats as Ken (the host) prepares the special tea in a golden bowl. Once prepared, the tea is drunk in three sips and then placed back before the host. The bowl is struck, a gong like sound comes forth and Ken bestows the visitor with a gift. (continued below)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.visualnews.com/2012/09/21/red-tea-ceremony-raises-awareness-for-fukushima/ken_hamakazi_red_tea_ceremony_fukushima_final/" rel="attachment wp-att-59878"><img src="http://cdn.visualnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Ken_Hamakazi_Red_Tea_Ceremony_Fukushima_Final-600x400.jpg" alt="" title="Ken_Hamakazi_Red_Tea_Ceremony_Fukushima_Final" width="600" height="400"></a></p>
<p>While Ken has been performing the Red Tea Ceremony for some time now, recently his tea ceremonies have been committed to Fukushima. He hopes to continue the global conversation about the after effects of the tragic nuclear meltdown and to further prompt a rapid international response so that the need is not greater than it already is.</p>
<p>I personally had the pleasure to participate in the ceremony this past month at <a href="http://www.burningman.com/">Burning Man</a>, where Ken has been attending for over ten years. In revisiting issue, it is clear that any country committed to protecting our environment from nuclear contamination needs to be involved in response. The <a href="http://www.iaea.org/">IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)</a> has received data from the Japanese Government and the <a href="https://iec.iaea.org/fmd/">Fukushima Monitoring Database (FMD)</a> has been made available to the public just last week. It is up to the global community to rally and respond. The truth about the real effects need to continue to be made known and addressed, and not &ndash; as has happened in some cases &ndash; revealed simple to &ldquo;save face&rdquo; or honor.  </p>
<p>I thank Ken for his ceremony. You can read more about Ken&rsquo;s work and visit his <a href="http://www.kenhamazaki.jp/e/index.htm">Red Museum </a>in Osaka if you decide to visit Japan.

<p><strong>What happens when the worlds of art and science merge?</strong> In the case of these brilliant images from microbiologist come artist Zachary Copfer, the result is some surprisingly different photography. Over the past 4 years he has diligently worked on creating a technique for exposing photographic images in petri dishes &ndash; using a process much like dark room developing.<span></span></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As a former microbiologist recently turned visual artist, I seek to create work that is less of an intersection of art and science and more of a genuine fusion of the two&rdquo; says Copfer. &ldquo;I believe that great beauty and poetry reside within the theories woven by scientists. And that it is through the unification of art and science that these treasures can be fully explored and made accessible to the world at large.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>To create the images Copfer uses either a petri dish coated with a living E. coli bacteria genetically modified to express GFP, or Serratia marcescens bacteria. He then exposes the dish like photographic paper, only in this case the enlarger has been replaced by a radiation source.</p>
<p>The resulting images, being created out of dots of various sizes and densities, are reminiscent of halftone images from a newspaper. His first series <a href="http://sciencetothepowerofart.com/2012/06/03/bacteria-portraits-bacteriogoraphy/">My Favorite Scientists</a>, features the heads of famous world changing scientists (with a nod to Picasso&rsquo;s almost scientific approach to advancing art), while his latest series <a href="http://sciencetothepowerofart.com/2012/06/11/star-stuff-galaxies-of-genetically-modified-e-coli/">Star Stuff</a> features a hanging universe of smaller petri dishes filled with glowing galaxy imagery.

<div class='chunk'>Health : The Atlantic<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~3/SxhvLAXGNlU/story01.htm>We're More Open-Minded Than We Think</a><p><i>Researchers show how easily we switch to arguing against our stated moral positions.</i></p>  <p>What's your stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Are you sure? In a <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0045457?imageURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0045457.t001">study</a> published in PLoS ONE, Swedish researchers got 160 survey respondents to report their positions on a variety of morally sticky concepts -- and then got the majority of them to change their minds without even realizing it.</p> <p>The video shows how they pulled off the trick, the gist of it being that the original statements that the participants rated their agreement or disagreement with were surreptitiously reversed. So when participants returned to their responses, it now appeared that they were agreeing or disagreeing with the direct opposite of what they had originally seen.&nbsp; And <i>voila --</i> those who found Israeli violence against Hamas morally reprehensible were suddenly supporting it.<br></p><p>These switches went unnoticed 69 percent of the time. This video doesn't show subjects arguing vehemently in favor of moral issues that they had just claimed to oppose, but 53 percent ending up doing just that, including the most polarized of respondents.</p> <p>The positive takeaway is that people are more open-minded than we generally give them credit for. The more pessimistic way of looking at it is that we aren't all that principled, and the conceptions of morality upon which society is built are actually a huge sham. If nothing else, it definitely calls to question the utility of surveys being able to tell us anything about what people actually think.</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625830/s/23ae9a41/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=We%27re+More+Open-Minded+Than+We+Think&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fwere-more-open-minded-than-we-think%2F262681%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=We%27re+More+Open-Minded+Than+We+Think&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fwere-more-open-minded-than-we-think%2F262681%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540661015/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ae9a41/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540661015/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ae9a41/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144540661015/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ae9a41/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~4/SxhvLAXGNlU" height="1" width="1"></div><div class='chunk'>Health : The Atlantic<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~3/qLnyM6AE3UU/story01.htm>Decorating for the Afterlife: The Modern American Mausoleum</a><p><i>"The peculiar mix of modernism and death reflects the things most kitsch, troubling, and beautiful about our modern culture."</i></p> <div><div align="center"><a href="http://flavorwire.com/"><img alt="flavorpillheader.PNG" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/culture_test/flavorpillheader.PNG" width="227" height="52"></a></div> <p> <span><a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/330128/10-of-the-creepiest-ghosts-in-literature"><b>The Creepiest Ghosts in Literature</b></a></span><br><span><a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/329019/abandoned-spaces-reclaimed-by-art"><b>Abandoned Spaces Reclaimed by Art</b></a></span><br><span><a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/326340/tv-sitcoms-most-boundary-breaking-families"><b>TV Sitcoms' Most Boundary-Breaking Families</b></a></span><br></p><hr></div> <p> In the 1950s, a fashion for interring the deceased in luxurious marble mausoleums (as opposed to burial plots) took hold -- as far as fashions for the dead can take hold, we mean. After taking a tour of one such facility, Chicago-based photographer <a href="http://www.johnfaier.com/">John Faier</a>&nbsp;was hooked, and spent six years photographing mausoleums from the time period all over the country. We spotted his resultant photo series,<em> <a href="http://www.johnfaier.com/personal_work.htm" target="_blank">Queen of Heaven</a></em>, over at <a href="http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2012/09/mausoleums-john-faier/" target="_blank">Raw File</a>. The mausoleums have an ominous, almost surreal feeling, like the chapel in the Overlook Hotel as photographed by David Lynch, both lavish and somehow hollow-feeling. "Bright colors, matching upholstery, matching lamp shades -- the architecture reminds us more of a cocktail lounger or hotel, not of a mausoleum," Faier muses. "The peculiar mix of modernism and death reflects the things most kitsch, troubling, and beautiful about our modern culture." Even more peculiar? Over six years of shooting, he says, he never ran into a mourner. </p><p></p> <img alt="ma11.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma11.jpg" width="600" height="450"><img alt="ma6.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma6.jpg" width="600" height="480"><img alt="ma8.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma8.jpg" width="600" height="480"><img alt="ma5.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma5.jpg" width="600" height="600"><img alt="ma9.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma9.jpg" width="600" height="600"><img alt="ma7.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma7.jpg" width="600" height="480"><img alt="ma.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma.jpg" width="600" height="600"><img alt="ma2.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma2.jpg" width="600" height="480"><img alt="ma3.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma3.jpg" width="600" height="600"><img alt="ma4.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma4.jpg" width="600" height="600"><div><em><small>Photos courtesy of <a href="http://www.johnfaier.com/">John Faier</a></small> </em></div><div><em><small><br></small></em></div><hr><em>This post also appears on <a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/330230/the-eerie-beauty-of-american-mausoleums?all=1">Flavorpill</a>, an </em>Atlantic<em> partner site. </em><p></p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625830/s/23ada88f/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Decorating+for+the+Afterlife%3A+The+Modern+American+Mausoleum&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fdecorating-for-the-afterlife-the-modern-american-mausoleum%2F262669%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Decorating+for+the+Afterlife%3A+The+Modern+American+Mausoleum&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fdecorating-for-the-afterlife-the-modern-american-mausoleum%2F262669%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145605771873/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ada88f/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145605771873/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ada88f/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145605771873/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ada88f/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~4/qLnyM6AE3UU" height="1" width="1"></div><div class='chunk'>Health : The Atlantic<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~3/G4D_9avq4As/story01.htm>The Therapeutic Experience of Being Suspended by Your Skin</a><p><i>The 5,000 year history of the "art" comes down to physics, spirituality, and risk.</i></p> <p><img alt="bodysuspensionmain3ap.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/bodysuspensionmain3ap45.jpg" width="615" height="300"></p><div>A man suspended in Lviv, Ukraine [Pavlo Palamarchuk/AP]</div> <p></p> <p> A woman lies face down on a massage table. She is tended to by five men wearing surgical masks and gloves. The men aren't wearing scrubs, though, and elaborate tattoos are visible on three of the men's arms. They insert large fishhooks under the woman's skin: in her calves, thighs, and lower, middle, and upper back. They work quickly and with practiced efficiency, grabbing a good sized piece of skin, pushing the hook into the skin until -- pop -- it slides in and out the other side. There is no blood. The men position the hook's bend around the freshly pierced hunk of flesh before moving onto another piercing. </p> <p> The woman goes by the name Trigger. She posted a video montage of several of her body suspensions -- a form of body modification that involves hanging a human body by hooks attached to ropes -- to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvQ57R0IoI4">YouTube</a>. In her video description, in an attempt to ward off hurtful comments from both the prejudiced and the Internet's resident ignoramuses, she wrote: </p> <blockquote> <p> This is a little music video I made to footage of some of my suspensions. Some were hard and painful, some were fun &amp; painful. Either way, I'm always grateful for the opportunities I had to do these suspensions and will never forget what an impact they have had and continue having on my life. </p> <p> Enjoy this video, but please, no comments about how gross this is... if you don't understand it or agree with it, that's perfectly okay, but there is no need for disrespectful comments. </p> </blockquote> <p> The rest of the video, after the piercings, shows Trigger suspended. She hangs in a number of positions: from hooks inserted into her upper back, known as a suicide suspension because the suspended person appears to have hanged him or herself; from the skin around her knees; and face down from hooks that run the length of her back and legs in what is called a Superman suspension. A suspension artist, who is responsible for setting up the hooks, ropes, and pulleys for the suspension, monitors the entire process. During some of Trigger's suspensions, a man hugs her tenderly and strokes her hair, rocking her body gently back and forth in the air. For the Superman suspension, she remains in a resting position. During one of her two suicide suspensions, she swings back and forth in a wide arc. </p> <p> "Really beautiful, thanks for sharing," one commenter wrote. </p> <blockquote>Tearing of the skin can, and does, happen, but it's almost never the sort of dramatic freefall that someone watching a suspension for the first time might imagine.</blockquote> <p> "Hey, just wanted to let you know that I am finally going up!" wrote another. "Thank you for giving me the inspiration to do this. I have a 4 pt knee scheduled for tomorrow!" </p> <p> One simply asked, "Why?" </p><p>***</p> <p> People have been hanging themselves from hooks for roughly 5,000 years. Perhaps the most ancient suspensions occurred in India, where suspension was a sort of religious penance. Devotees at the ancient Hindu festival Thaipusam, which continues to this day throughout Southeast Asia and is popular among Tamils, suspend themselves in a practice called <em>vel kavadi</em>. Those who perform the <em>vel kavadi </em>pierce their flesh with hooks and skewers -- stand-ins for the spear that Shiva's wife, Parvati, gave to the god of war Murugan to kill the demon Soorapadam -- as an expression of debt bondage and devotion to Murugan. The pierced worshippers often attach ropes to their hooks, which are pulled by other devotees or used to suspend the worshippers in the air. The level of pain the suspended feels correlates with the level of devotion--the more pain, the more sincere the worship. Suspensions also occur at the Chidi Mari festival, another Tamil holiday. </p> <p> Half a world away, on the banks of the Missouri River, the Mandan tribe suspended young warriors in an annual rite of passage ceremony that celebrated the creation of the earth. The Okipa ceremony, as it was called, required initiates to fast and hold vigil for four days, then dance, and lastly perform trials of endurance. The warriors-to-be had to prove their strength to their elders and the spirits. The young men were suspended from the roof of the tribe's lodge by ropes attached to skewers in their chest, back or shoulders. To increase the pain, weights were attached to their legs. Cries of agony were considered cowardly. The warriors would faint and were brought down to be watched over by the men who presided over the ceremony. When an initiate woke up, it signified the spirits' approval.&nbsp;</p><p>The new initiates then had their left pinky removed with a hatchet, and finished the ceremony by racing around the village in a race called "the last race." The skewers were still in place, the weights still attached. The Okipa ceremony was first documented by an outsider around 1835 when George Catlin, an American painter on an expedition with William Clark, produced a painting of the ceremony. The last Okipa ceremony took place in 1889. A variation of the Okipa ceremony was made famous in the 1973 film <em>A Man Called Horse </em>when Richard Harris' character underwent a similar ceremony in order to gain acceptance from the Lakota tribe that had taken him prisoner. </p> <p> Though many people who practice suspension see it as a spiritual experience and a way to test themselves, most suspensions today are not performed as religious sacraments or trials of endurance. For some, it's a sort of, "If I can do this, I can do anything," attitude. For others, it is akin to meditation.&nbsp;</p><p>Modern suspension has been largely shaped by Fakir Musafar, a man who was born on an Indian reservation in South Dakota with the name Roland Loomis and developed, or brought back, many types of suspension. Musafar performed the Okipa suspension in 1966 and also coined the term "modern primitives" to describe a subculture that practices body modification with a particular interest in rite of passage rituals. For Musafar, and many others after him, body modification is a form of self-expression and spiritual exploration, a way to move beyond the body into a higher spiritual plane. But others who practice suspension today distance themselves from the sort of ritualistic elements espoused by Musafar, and instead choose to hang for the sake of hanging. </p><p>***</p><p><br></p> <p> </p><blockquote>"And this was just the ultimate stress release. Everything bad that had built up, it was just resetting it back to zero."</blockquote> <p></p> <p>Cere Coichetti is the head of the New York chapter of Rites of Passage, a group that facilitates suspensions up and down the east coast. He first was introduced to suspension twelve years ago through his friend Brian, a body modification artist in New York. Brian had a friend, Emrys, who had recently moved to New York from Boston and who practiced suspension, something that Coichetti, though active in the body modification scene, hadn't heard of. Suspension requires a small team of helpers to set up and monitor the suspension, and Emrys enlisted Coichetti and Brian to help him suspend. Within a week or so, Coichetti tried his first suspension -- a Superman. </p> <div> <img alt="SHARK300200.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/suspension200300bw.jpg" width="200" height="300">A Superman at a suspension conference in Tel Aviv. [AmirCohen/Reuters]</div> <p> "I wanted to see if I was tough enough to do it," Coichetti said with a smile as we talked over meatball sliders at a restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. "It came down to a challenge to myself, a test of strength. If I can put hooks in my body -- suspend my near 300-pound frame from little hooks -- then there's nothing I couldn't do. I thought it was going to hurt. I thought it was going to suck. I thought it was going to be the most traumatizing experience of my life." </p> <p> Coichetti's body is covered in tattoos, and his head, shaved bald, is adorned with a neatly trimmed goatee. In his ears, for aesthetic reasons, he has removed the cartilage around the ear canal in what is known as a conch removal. It's possible to see through the little holes in his ears, but you wouldn't even notice the modification unless you sat down and talked with him. He is lively and expressive, and as he told me about his first suspension, he did a good deal of speaking with his hands. </p> <p> "So, I go in and I'm ready to go through it," he said, "and once I got into the air, once they lifted me up, it was the most peaceful, serene, blissful experience I've ever had. And it was kind of like, throughout life, you tend to take on negative energy -- by energy I could mean stress -- stress from your job, stress from home, if you're married, if you've got kids -- just stress. And this was just the ultimate stress release. Everything bad that had built up, it was just resetting it back to zero."</p> <p> "The second I came down, I knew I wanted to go back up." </p> <p> Shortly after his first suspension, Coichetti began to study the rigging aspects of suspension. He consulted Allen Falkner, one of Fakir Musafar's apprentices and also one of the greatest influences on suspension as a non-ritualistic act, to learn about suspension techniques. </p> <p> Coichetti says that he has helped people from all walks of life suspend, including lawyers, wrestlers, doctors, acrobats and politicians. Two of Trigger's suspensions in her YouTube video were done by Rites of Passage. The group performs suspensions free of charge, but ask for a suggested donation to cover the cost of hooks and other equipment. Any money Rites of Passage receives in excess of the suggested donation goes to sending the group's members to certification courses in first aid and industrial rigging. </p> <p> "Suspension can be broken into two aspects," Coichetti said, "basically the medical aspect and the rigging aspect. By medical, I mean the insertion of the hooks, the cleaning, the blood, the skin, how that all works. The hard part about suspension has nothing to do with the body. It's everything above the hooks." </p> <p> The rigging methods of suspension are borrowed from techniques developed for construction, rock climbing, and stage rigging (think Cirque de Soleil). Those who master the rigging techniques are referred to as suspension artists. </p> <p> "The term <i>suspension artist </i>is a bit misleading," Coichetti said. Suspension is, he insisted, a skill. "It's not really an art. Anyone can learn to be a suspension artist. It's science. It's math. It's understanding principles and practicing and putting those principles into effect. </p> <p> "When we go up to install rigging points, we need to know what the ceiling is made of, how it's constructed, what it can support. I need to know what it's already supporting on top of it. If I'm stressing a ceiling at a fracture point where they have an air compression unit on top of it, I need to know that." </p> <p> The rest, Coichetti said, is all physics, and it boils down to F=MA. </p> <p> "When I have a pulley system on a ceiling, if you weigh 100 pounds, I have to exert 100 pounds to lift you off the ground," he said. "Now, you also have motion. You have to figure out the angle of motion, the rate of acceleration. I do it in my head. I have to figure out how much stress you are putting on the top rig, on the pulley, on the rope, on your hooks, on yourself, and I have to make sure everything is within a correct range." </p> <p> To more easily hoist the weight of a human body, suspension artists make use of mechanical advantage, rigging up complex pulley systems that facilitate the raising and lowering of the suspended person. Coichetti once rigged a woman in a marionette suspension, where hooks were inserted on the woman's back, into her legs, and into her arms, so that the woman was suspended as a living, breathing marionette controlled by Coichetti with the movement of his hand and arm. </p> <p> "I had to figure out a way to attach all her points to a glove," Coichetti said. "So that going like this," he moved two fingers up and down as if playing a piano, "would raise her left arm, would raise her right arm. And I had to rig it all so that just three inches of motion would create four feet of motion on her side." Moving his arm up and down lowered and raised the woman. </p> <p> He acknowledged, though, that he had a little help with lifting the woman's limbs with his fingers--most people, he said, when they feel a hook pulling on their arm tend to raise their arm along with the upward pull. </p><p>***</p> <p> The most visibly jarring thing about watching a suspension is seeing flesh stretch as it supports the weight of the body. It looks like it's about to rip -- sending the suspended person falling to the ground amidst a confetti of torn flesh and blood -- but it's actually quite safe. During a suspension, hooks are inserted under the dermis and into the subcutaneous fatty tissue, a very resilient chunk of flesh. </p> <p> "Skin is pretty strong," Dr. Nelson Goldberg, a plastic surgeon at the University of Maryland Medical Center, said. "It's basically leather, and in the back it's basically double leather. I think it could easily handle the tension before it would rip." </p> <p> Dr. Brett King, an assistant professor of dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine, sees suspension as an application of physics and a testament to the human body's remarkable toughness and healing ability. </p> <div> <img alt="SHARK300200.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/RTR2OPDY300200susp.jpg" width="300" height="200">[AmirCohen/Reuters]</div> <p> "You're putting your body's weight worth of force across that tissue," King said, "and it's quite striking that the skin holds up as well as it does. My guess is that, whether or not the practitioners of suspension realize it or not, the people who plant the hooks in the skin understand that there's a tremendous amount of physics to all of this. They must use hooks that are appropriately thick to hook an appropriately broad swath of skin. You can imagine, if you were to take something as thin as a slim nail and kind of loop it under the skin and back out, and then pull the two ends away from the body, it might very well rip the skin. Alternatively, if a much wider nail or hook is sewn underneath and back out across a wide enough section of skin, then suddenly there is enough fabric to support the weight. It's a calculation that involves the total dimension of skin across which you're supporting some amount of weight." </p> <p> "It's kind of dazzling," he said, "to conceive the entire body's weight being supported by a couple of hooks through the chest." </p> <p> "It's pretty cool," he added. </p> <p> When I asked Coichetti to describe the sensation of being suspended, he said, "It's this odd pressure, and it almost feels like--" he paused, thinking. "Do you ever stand in the sunlight, like at the beach, and, not that it hurts, but you can feel when you're burning? Like, 'Aw, man, I can feel the heat. I can feel myself burning. I know I've gotta get out of the sunlight.' That burning sensation. You feel that. It's not painful, but you definitely feel burning. And you feel this odd pressure happening. Once you're in the air for, like, 30 or 40 seconds, that burn fades away. And then you get hit with the euphoria. You still feel the pressure, but at that point in time, you're elsewhere." </p> <p> "Grab the meat of our best friend's back and just yank up really hard," AJ Karras suggested. "Try to pick them up, too." </p> <p> Karras, a young woman with pink hair, came to New York City from outside Amherst, Massachusetts, to be suspended for the first time by Coichetti. She was excited, and her boyfriend had come with her for his first suspension, too. Karras has been involved in the body modification scene for about five years, and has been helping out with suspensions and heavier body modifications, mostly types of cosmetic implants, for the last two. </p> <p> "I saw suspension videos when I was 15 years old," she said, "and I was like, 'Dude, I have to try that. I just have to.' I just always knew that it was part of me." </p> <p> I asked her what types of suspension she was interested in trying. </p> <p> "All of them," she said without hesitation. "Eventually. Gotta let my body heal up between, but eventually I want to try as many different and new things as we can think of." </p> <p> Tearing of the skin can, and does, happen, but it's almost never the sort of dramatic freefall that someone watching a suspension for the first time might imagine. There are certain parts of the body, like the knees and the chest, where tearing is more likely to occur. Tearing happens slowly, and there is more than enough time, Coichetti said, to get the suspended person down on the ground before there is any serious injury. Skilled suspension artists can tell when the skin is beginning to tear, and will inform the suspended person what is going on. </p> <blockquote>Coichetti's biggest concern about suspension is that people will try to imitate what they see on the Internet without the proper medical and technical knowledge required to perform a safe suspension.</blockquote> <p> "When someone is in the air and they're swinging around," Coichetti said, "and I see that tearing has begun, I'll stop them and be like, 'Your skin is beginning to tear. It's not an issue right now, but in about a minute or two it's going to get to the point where you need a stitch or two. Are you comfortable with that?' If someone's in danger of the skin completely opening, we bring them down. They don't have a choice. But if you're suspending and you're at this moment, most people go, 'Leave me up here, suture me later.'" </p> <p> You can find examples of suspensions gone wrong on the Internet. At a certain point, skin gives out, as King said. In most cases when a suspended person falls, though, the fall isn't due to the skin actually ripping. Improper insertion of the hooks, in conjunction with a high degree of motion, can result in the hooks sliding out. Professionals who are attempting suspensions at great heights or suspensions that involve a good deal of motion will rig up a safety harness that acts as a failsafe should the hooks come out for some reason.&nbsp;</p><p>One video on Hook Life, a blog that caters to the suspension community, shows a Russian suspension team suspending a man in an abandoned warehouse. The man freefalls from a great height, then swings back and forth. He is harnessed in. Hook Life, though, added a lengthy disclaimer before posting the video, warning readers, essentially, not to try this at home. Coichetti's biggest concern about suspension is that people will try to imitate what they see on the Internet without the proper medical and technical knowledge required to perform a safe suspension. </p> <p> Both King and Goldberg considered infection to be the greatest risk during suspension, but knowledgeable suspension artists use sterilized hooks, needles, and gauze when suspending someone to minimize the risk. Some scarring is inevitable, but when Coichetti showed me a point on his leg where he had suspended seven times, I wouldn't have noticed anything if it weren't for a white spot in a tattoo, evidence of where hooks had been. There is, as King suggested, a high level of physics and medical knowledge being put to use during a suspension, and Coichetti says safety is his number one priority. He is a certified first responder, meaning he is trained in providing pre-hospital care for medical emergencies, and a volunteer fire fighter. Most of his team are certified in first aid care, and two of the suspension artists in the Rites of Passage Boston chapter are paramedics. If someone has a medical condition that would complicate a suspension, he consults the person's doctor to clear him or her for suspension. He has turned some people looking to suspend away due to the medical risks that a condition presents. </p> <p> "It's up to the individual to figure out if the harm involved -- which, realistically is very minimal -- is worth what they get out of it," Coichetti said. "And the answer for suspenders is yes. Shock can be life threatening, but, I mean, you break your leg, you go into shock. Shock is on a spectrum," he made a wide space with his two hands, "we're just fucking around in this range," he said, using two fingers to indicate the very low end. And, he says, if something ever were to go wrong, the first thing he would do would be to call an ambulance. </p> <p> That feeling of shock is what many who suspend are looking for -- the rush of endorphins, serotonin, and other chemicals that results in a sort of high. Some see it as a spiritual experience. Others find it exhilarating, and laugh while they are suspended. A subset of those who practice suspension do it as a type of performance art, choreographing lurid and shocking spectacles that are performed in front of audiences. </p> <p> "A performance is there to shock the hell out of you," Coichetti said. "They're going to scream, they're going to make it look like it's the most bloody, painful, awful thing in the world. And it's all an act to get a visceral reaction out of the audience." </p> <p> Performance suspensions, Coichetti said, with their focus on shock value, can cheapen the type of suspension that he practices, which focuses more on creating a unique experience tailored to the suspended person. </p> <p> "I feel like it puts out the wrong public perception about what we do," he said. </p> <p> <strong></strong> </p> <p> "Spirituality is very important to me," Coichetti said. But, he clarified, "I'm very technical. I look at, when I'm doing a suspension or any kind of ritual, what physically is going on. I want to know what's causing this euphoria. We're in a world nowadays where I don't have to go, 'Oh, the state of euphoria is caused by this god raining down on me.' This state of euphoria is caused by <em>these</em> certain chemicals being released because of <em>these</em> physical triggers. I will absolutely suspend you and have a drum circle going on, beating on drums and chanting; not because I'm a hippy, but because I know steady bass rhythms allow your brain to function at a theta level and it allows you to trance easier."</p> <p> "Now, even though I'm very technical and I want to get into the chemistry of this, it's still a spiritual experience. Is it spiritual to a god? To the world? To myself? I don't know, I'll figure that out one day," he said with a smile. "All I know is that my end result, regardless of how I get there, is a feeling of complete freedom." </p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625830/s/23acd65f/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=The+Therapeutic+Experience+of+Being+Suspended+by+Your+Skin&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fthe-therapeutic-experience-of-being-suspended-by-your-skin%2F262644%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=The+Therapeutic+Experience+of+Being+Suspended+by+Your+Skin&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fthe-therapeutic-experience-of-being-suspended-by-your-skin%2F262644%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608326434/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23acd65f/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608326434/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23acd65f/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608326434/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23acd65f/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~4/G4D_9avq4As" height="1" width="1"></div><div class='chunk'>Health : The Atlantic<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~3/VSteUjkBwoU/story01.htm>Study: Oxytocin ('The Hormone of Love') Also Makes Us Conformists</a><p> <em>You think your tastes are your own, but it may actually be that a hormone is making members of a groups share the same preferences.</em> </p> <img alt="sheepmain.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/sheepmain.jpg" height="230" width="615"><span>Rambling Traveler/Flickr</span> <p> <strong>PROBLEM: </strong> Oxytocin, which you may also know as "the hormone of love," is the <a href="http://io9.com/5925206/10-reasons-why-oxytocin-is-the-most-amazing-molecule-in-the-world">driving force</a> behind sociability, trust, and generosity.

But for the sake of standardization (and because you can't fake a hug), researchers administered the hormone via nasal spray to 34 subjects and a placebo to 35 others. The men participated in unrelated busywork until the oxytocin kicked in, at which point they were asked to rate symbols on an attractiveness scale of 1 to 11. ("<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbVKWCpNFhY">These go to eleven.</a>")&nbsp;</p><p>As they did so, they were shown everyone else's responses, including those of the other members of their randomly-determined "group." To ensure that people weren't trying to win social favor by agreeing with others in their group, the participants were not aware of one another's identities. </p> <p> <strong>RESULTS: </strong> Barring the chance that some of the symbols were inherently more attractive than others, the subjects demonstrated a general tendency to conform to other people's opinions: oxytocin or not, they gave significantly higher ratings to symbols that other participants also liked, and vice-versa. But in cases where one's group liked a symbol and "outsiders" didn't, the subjects doped with oxytocin trended toward their group members' ratings. This held regardless of how many favorable or disfavorable opinions they saw before passing their own judgment and was not observed in the placebo group. </p> <p> <strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Oxytocin stimulates in-group conformity -- to the extent that subjective preference is influenced by horde mentality. <br></p> <p> <strong>IMPLICATIONS: </strong> Oxytocin's effects were context-dependent, only causing conformity when the in-group's opinion was opposed to the out-group's. It may be that the hormone promotes in-group identification through shared biases, suggest the authors, ultimately functioning in the same way that team uniforms or gang colors do "to signal group membership and establish intergroup differentiation." </p> <p> <em> The full study, "<a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/09/18/0956797612446026.abstract?rss=1">The Herding Hormone; Oxytocin Stimulates In-Group Conformity</a>," </em> <em>will be published in the journal </em><a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/"> Psychological Science</a>.<em> </em> </p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625830/s/23ab511d/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Study%3A+Oxytocin+%28%27The+Hormone+of+Love%27%29+Also+Makes+Us+Conformists&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fstudy-oxytocin-the-hormone-of-love-also-makes-us-conformists%2F262637%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Study%3A+Oxytocin+%28%27The+Hormone+of+Love%27%29+Also+Makes+Us+Conformists&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fstudy-oxytocin-the-hormone-of-love-also-makes-us-conformists%2F262637%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608321447/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ab511d/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608321447/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ab511d/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608321447/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ab511d/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~4/VSteUjkBwoU" height="1" width="1"></div>

In this project he worked with Joanna Paw&#322;owska, without her, there would be no pilot.&nbsp;</p>

For this latest episode of the Engadget Show, we set up shop right there, in order to explore what it means when technology itself is a work of art. We're starting things off at the New Museum on the Bowery in Manhattan, where Tim and Brian will be diving deep into the "Ghosts in the Machine" exhibition, to check out pieces like Stan VanDerBeek's Movie-Drome, a dome dreamed up in the mid-60s that foresaw a world in which the viewer is bombarded by visual stimuli. We'll also discuss how the museum is harnessing the power of the web to open its offerings up well beyond its gallery doors.</p><p> We speak to the founder and principle players of comedy performance art group Improv Everywhere about the role technology has played in the rise of the group and some of its most famous (and infamous) pranks. As ever, we're breaking out the Gadget Table to discuss the month's latest and greatest (and not-so-greatest), including the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/18/apple-iphone-5-review/">iPhone 5</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/11/amazon-kindle-fire-hd-review-7-inch/">Amazon's Kindle Fire</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/15/samsung-galaxy-note-10-1-review/">Samsung's Galaxy Note 10.1</a>, before Brian heads out to the private (annex) library of comedian-turned-deranged-billionaire <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/john+hodgman/">John Hodgman</a> to discuss how technology is impacting the publishing industry.</p><p> While we're at it, we'll be speaking with the producer and director of the classic film <em>Baraka</em> and its newly released spiritual sequel, <em>Samsara</em> and paying a visit to the gang at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/BreakfastNy/">Breakfast New York</a>, who have worked with the likes of Google and Conan O'Brien to turn advertising into art. All that and the introduction of our latest feature "Ask @hodgman."

Primarily based off of XBMC 11, the latest software bump for this long-running Linux distro introduces a few nifty features, such as: PVR support for DVB-T (watch and record live TV), full HD video for PandaBoard systems, full HD support for CuBox and improved HDD installation. A year in the making, GeeXbox 3.0 weighs in at a hefty 140MB, nearly double the size of the platform's last official release. In addition to its new bells and whistles, version 3.0 has "preliminary" <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/raspberrypi">Raspberry Pi</a> support baked into its development tree. So, if you've been plotting like Wile E.

The company seems to fall farther and farther behind the home-grown search powerhouse <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/baidu">Baidu</a>. The latest battle Mountain View has been forced to concede is in the world of music. Google Music Search launched in 2009 as a legal alternative to Baidu's own tool that turned up primarily illicitly shared results. The service never took off, even with the backing of a local partner, and things only got worse when the web giant <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/12/google-to-stop-censoring-chinese-search-results-soon-china-wa/">ceased censoring results</a> and took it wares to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/22/google-cn-now-rerouting-to-hong-kong-domain-an-entirely-legal/">Hong Kong</a>. The fatal blow came last year when Baidu signed a licensing deal with <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/07/19/chinas-baidu-licenses-music-from-major-us-record-labels-for-str/">One-Stop China</a> -- a joint venture of Universal, Warner and Sony BMG. Since that day, you could argue that Google has only been postponing the inevitable. Today's announcement officially begins the countdown, and on October 19th Google Music Search will close its doors for good in China.</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/" rel="tag">Internet</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/google-shutters-music-search-in-china/">Google shutters Music Search in China, concedes battle to Baidu</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 14:12:00 EDT.

Both the 8-megapixel IMX134 and 13-megapixel IMX135 are scaling back from their original RGBW (red, green, blue, white) coding to an ordinary RGB over concerns that they aren't meeting Sony's "image quality standards" as originally designed.

Other additions include WiFi (previous iterations relied on Bluetooth) to hook up to your Android or iOS device with, a larger 1,200 mAh battery and improved low light performance. Owners of previous models might spot that with new features comes a new, larger form. The price of evolution it seems. The price for the device, on the other hand, is $279, or $329 if you opt for the "Explore" bundle, which incidentally you can pre-order now.

That's what we'll see if regulatory screenings and leaks surrounding the unreleased Lumia 510 are any indication. China's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/TENAA/">TENAA</a>, the FCC and Indonesia's DG PosTel have all taken a look at the device ahead of time and point to a short, squat design that won't have the budget chic of the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/13/nokia-lumia-610-review/">Lumia 610</a>. However, if Baidu tips are correct, the 510 may be an ever-so-slight upgrade to its higher-digit predecessor with a larger 4-inch screen and a likely fast track to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/26/lumia-900-windows-phone-7-8-video-demo-start/">Windows Phone 7.8</a>. Just don't anticipate more than the existing 800MHz Snapdragon, 256MB of RAM and 5-megapixel camera -- or a US release, for that matter. The FCC has only tested the Lumia 510 against American GSM bands, which hints that its 3G support is meant for China, Indonesia and other countries where low-cost smartphones matter most.</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/" rel="tag">Mobile</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/nokia-lumia-510-put-under-the-regulatory-limelight/">Nokia Lumia 510 put under the regulatory limelight, hints low-cost Windows Phone 7.8 on the way</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 11:44:00 EDT.

Today, those of you with <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/16/verizon-galaxy-nexus-review/">Verizon-branded Galaxy Nexus</a> handsets (at least those that didn't run out and download an unofficial Jelly Bean) are finally getting your reward. Android version 4.1.1 (better known as <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/29/jelly-bean-pre-release-for-verizon-galaxy-nexus-now-available/">JRO03O</a> among the hack happy) is being pushed out OTA to Big Red customers, complete with the preemptive magic of Google Now in tow. If you haven't seen an alert yet, head to the About Phone section in your settings, and tap System Updates. Having recently been welcomed back to the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/10/verizon-galaxy-nexus-welcomed-back-into-the-aosp-fold/">AOSP</a> fold, we'd have hoped for an update sooner, but it's still among the first wave of handsets to move to the latest version of Android. Now if only this would restore <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/14/verizon-galaxy-nexus-lose-google-wallet/">Google Wallet</a> functionality. (Hey, a guy can dream can't he?)

The design is a near-exact replica of the iconic Swiss railway clock designed in 1955 by Hans Hilfiker and since licensed for use in Mondaine watches. Not surprisingly, both Swiss railway operator SBB and the Mondaine Group have also noticed the striking similarity, and they say they're now looking at ways to remedy the situation with Apple. For its part, an SBB spokesperson tells <em>Reuters</em> that "SBB isn't hurt, but proud that his icon of watch design is being used by a globally active and successful business," while Mondaine co-owner Andre Bernheim notes that "the app is pretty much identical to our Mondaine watch," and adds that these "three companies together -- Apple, SBB and Mondaine -- can together achieve something positive. We'll see how this all ends up." Apple has yet to offer a comment on the matter.

Today, NYC's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) made the pact official, signing regulations that will replace the city's iconic line of Crown Victorias (and myriad other cabs) with the NV200 beginning in October 2013. As Nissan puts it, today's signing, "officially makes the NV200 the taxicab of New York City."</p><p> The NV200 van beat out competition from the likes of Ford to take New York City's coveted "Taxi of Tomorrow" award months ago. When Engadget EIC (and gearhead) Tim Stevens explored the NV200 at the New York Auto Show, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/04/nissan-nv200-taxi-of-tomorrow-hands-on-video/">he called it</a> "a huge advance" over existing taxi stock. And hey, will all those amenities, we can't disagree. Most exciting for commuters: Nissan's NV200 taxi features separate climate controls for passengers, as well as USB slots for mobile charging. "Taxi of Tomorrow" indeed!</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/misc/" rel="tag">Misc</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/transportation/" rel="tag">Transportation</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/alt/" rel="tag">Alt</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/nyc-nissan-nv200-taxi-of-tomorrow/">New York City, meet your new official taxi: the Nissan NV200</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 10:51:00 EDT.

This time it's the LG Venice for Boost Mobile: a rebadged version of the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/29/lg-optimus-l7-review/">Optimus L7</a> that just so happens to sport a handsome silvery backplate. This is the second version of the Optimus L7 to be geared for US shores, the first being the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/11/lg-splendor-now-available-at-us-cellular-for-80-after-rebate/">Splendor</a> for US Cellular. Absent any drastic changes, shoppers can rightfully expect to find an Android 4.0 smartphone that's paired with a single-core 1GHz CPU, a 4.3-inch WVGA display and a 5-megapixel camera that'll capture video at 720p. Unfortunately, pricing for the Venice remains up in the air, which makes it difficult to know whether it'll provide much of a value proposition within Boost's lineup. Likewise, the all-important release date is also a mystery, although with the carrier <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/19/zte-warp-sequent-now-available-on-boost-mobile-for-200/">actively</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/22/boost-mobile-announces-samsung-galaxy-rush/">refreshing</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/22/boost-mobile-galaxy-s-ii-4g/">its fall</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/17/kyocera-hydro-hitting-boost-on-august-3rd-for-130-lets-you-get/">lineup</a>, a near-term arrival is certainly within reason.</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/" rel="tag">Mobile</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/lg-optimus-l7-leaks-for-boost-mobile-as-the-venice/">LG Optimus L7 leaks for Boost Mobile as the Venice</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 10:34:00 EDT.

A Mannheim, Germany court has ruled that neither company infringes on an Apple patent covering how an OS responds to and ignores touch events. While we don't yet know the full details, patent lawsuit guru Florian Mueller suggests that the German judge took the same point of view that thwarted Apple's claims in the Netherlands and the UK: the particular patent was just too broad to stick. It's a potentially important win, as a ruling of violation could have led to serious problems with keeping Android-based Motorola and Samsung devices in stores; other patents are more easily circumvented. However, it's still something of a Pyrrhic victory for a pair of companies that have lately been facing the threat of near-term bans and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/25/breaking-down-apples-1-billion-courtroom-victory-over-samsung/">steep damages</a>.</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/" rel="tag">Mobile</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/german-court-rules-that-motorola-samsung-dont-violate-apple-patent/">German court rules that Motorola, Samsung don't violate Apple touch event patent</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 09:55:00 EDT.

As such, they're tightening the rules on product pitches to prevent anything too nebulous getting through the vetting process. Projects using simulations or renderings are prohibited from today, forcing creators to demonstrate working prototypes of their inventions. The site is also adding a section called "Risks and Challenges," where contributors have to demonstrate their business, tech and planning acumen by explaining how they'll cope with problems that arise further down the road. Finally, Kickstarter is also preventing job-lots of products being offered as a funding reward (except for things like <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/20/digispark-kickstarter-arduino-jr/">Ardunio-esque</a> sets, where it's reasonable to expect multiple units) -- ending the days of getting 30 nuclear-powered iPhone cases for the low, low price of $1,000.</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/" rel="tag">Internet</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/kickstarter-clampdown/">Kickstarter tells users 'We are not a store,' tightens rules for hardware pitches</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 09:41:00 EDT.

Depending on which country you're in, you might pick it up as the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/09/sony-xperia-gx-packs-13-megapixel-camera-and-4-6-inch-hd-display/">Xperia GX</a>, or possibly even the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/29/sony-xperia-tx-hands-on/">TX</a>. The final review sample that's been passed our desk, however, is the Xperia T, the European HSPA version, headed to O2's UK stores in the coming weeks, at which point it will be free on &pound;36 per-month contracts and likely replace the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/08/sony-xperia-s-review/">Xperia S</a> as Sony's Android flagship. In comparison to Sony's Spring smartphone, there's a similar 720p display, now stretched out to 4.6 inches, a different 13-megapixel camera, a new 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 processor and Android ICS -- with the promise of Jelly Bean soon after it hits store. The Xperia T also revives a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/06/sony-ericsson-xperia-arc-s-review/">familiar hardware curve</a> and has picked up onscreen Android buttons on its design journey. Design twists and promises of the latest OS aside, has Sony finally built a top-tier phone capable of going toe-to-toe with the smartphone heavyweights?

Nokia undoubtedly did, as it's using the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/18/apple-iphone-5-review/">iPhone 5</a> launch to remind us that its strategy has been <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/19/nokia-wants-to-become-the-where-company/">all about location lately</a>. The crew in Espoo has pitted Nokia Maps from the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/05/nokia-lumia-920-hands-on/">Lumia 920</a> against both Apple's equivalent as well as Google Maps -- and to no one's surprise, Nokia's own platform comes out on top. In practice, it's a relatively frank comparison that doesn't try to win on every point. Nokia tends to use a liberal definition of the term "3D" that includes augmented reality, but it's otherwise willing to emphasize its advantages in offline mapping and the sheer scope of its mapping coverage. Apple's very young mapping effort struggles, while Nokia is willing to accept that it doesn't have as much traffic coverage as Google. There is, however, the slight problem of the Lumia 920 not yet shipping: unless you've been blessed with a prototype of the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/WindowsPhone8/">Windows Phone 8</a> device, Apple and Google are the only ones that have their latest navigation software on a phone you can actually buy.

While it may be the center of attention at the moment, however, it's certainly not the only device that crossed our desks this week. We also have reviews of Motorola's budget-friendly Droid RAZR M and HP's new Ultrabook, the Envy Spectre XT. In addition, we grill IBM Research's Dr. Michael Karasick for Q&amp;A, head to Germany for <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/20/photokina-2012-wrap-up/">Photokina</a> in Hands-On, and get an eye-full of Pi for Visualized.

He's responsible (in part) for bringing shows like <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/22/pbs-screens-the-cultural-eye-candy-early-to-apple-devices-usher/"><em>Boardwalk Empire </em></a>and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/14/hbo-and-blinkbox-offer-second-season-of-game-of-thrones-online-b/"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a> to our screens, after all.

While the public days continue through the weekend, us media types are headed back to our respective homelands until next September. The lasting impression from the week -- aside from eating massive amounts of gyoza -- will undoubtedly be the news <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/sony/">Sony</a> dropped the day before the show started at its own press event. A new, even <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/19/sony-playstation-3-2012-up-close-and-personal-eyes-on/">slimmer PS3</a> is on the way and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/19/sony-playstation-vita-sapphire-blue-hands-on/">two new colors</a> for the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/13/playstation-vita-review/">PS Vita</a> were outed -- at least for Japan. On the show floor, though, we encountered some peripherals well-suited for other gaming tech like Nintendo's 3DS XL, Xbox 360 and PC rigs. You can peek at those for yourself in the <strike>Sony</strike> Tokyo Game Show gallery that follows and relive all the action in the wrap-up that lies just beyond the break.

Users of RIM's BlackBerry service in the EMEA region are at the wrong end of a network problem affecting BBM, email and internet. At the moment it doesn't appear to be of the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/12/blackberry-outage-spreads-to-canada-continues-in-europe-middle/">vast and crippling</a> scale <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/13/rim-founder-apologizes-for-blackberry-outage-weve-let-many-of/">as last time</a>, but small consolation if you're one of the unlucky ones. RIM has acknowledged the issue, and you can bet the farm on the fact there is more than a handful of slightly stressed engineers on the case, hoping to keep customers from making that impulse purchase. Let us know in the comments if you're affected.</p><p> <strong>Update:</strong> We've just received this official statement from RIM in the UK:</p><blockquote> <p>  "<span lang="EN-US">Our apologies to any customers impacted by the BlackBerry service issue today. We can confirm that services have been restored and are now operating normally."</span></p></blockquote><p> <strong>Update 2:</strong> RIM has now issued a statement from CEO Thorsten Heins on the matter, in which he also apologizes and notes that up to six percent of the company's user base may have been affected with a "maximum delay of 3 hours in the delivery and reception of their messages."</p><blockquote> <p>  I want to apologize to those BlackBerry customers in Europe and Africa who experienced an impact in their quality of service earlier this morning. The BlackBerry service is now fully restored and I can report that no data or messages were lost. Up to 6 percent of our user base may have been impacted. Preliminary analysis suggests that those customers may have experienced a maximum delay of 3 hours in the delivery and reception of their messages. We are conducting a full technical analysis of this quality of service issue and will report as soon as it concludes. I again want to apologize to those customers who were impacted today.</p></blockquote><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/" rel="tag">Mobile</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/blackberry-outage-affecting-users-in-europe-middle-east-and-afr/">BlackBerry outage affecting users in Europe, Middle East and Africa (update: service restored?)</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 06:55:00 EDT.

Version 2.0 adds something extra, however: a section called "Metal" that is all about putting your processor and memory through the wringer.</p><p> As a quick taster, we ran the new HTML5 and Metal tests on the HTC One X (both global and AT&amp;T) and the Galaxy S III (global and Sprint), settling on the average of three consecutive results. Conspiracy theorists who think that Qualcomm's app favors its own processors will only find further ammunition in the CPU results, however the HTML5 scores actually give the QCOM devices much <em>less </em>of a lead than the old Vellamo did, scoring all four handsets roughly equally. You'll find the table overleaf, along with a publicity video that explains the update.</p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/vellamo-benchmark-adds-cpu-and-memory-tests/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Vellamo benchmark adds CPU and memory tests, here's how it rates the One X and GS III</em></a></p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/" rel="tag">Mobile</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/vellamo-benchmark-adds-cpu-and-memory-tests/">Vellamo benchmark adds CPU and memory tests, here's how it rates the One X and GS III</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 06:31:00 EDT.

The photo above was posted to a Chinese forum thread entitled "Padfone 2 specs revealed" by a user called cj1024, and indeed the A68 model number at the top of the list does sound appropriate, considering the original <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/12/asus-padfone-review/">Padfone</a> was the A66. If we assume it's legit, for the sake of argument, then maybe we can expect ASUS's next modular phone to come with the same quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor and 13-megapixel camera resolution that are already strutting around in the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/17/lg-optimus-g-hands-on-with-koreas-latest-powerhouse-video/?a_dgi=aolshare_twitter">LG Optimus G</a>, alongside an uncommonly bright, 4.7-inch 1280 x 720 Super IPS+ display, LTE and 2GB of RAM.

Old hat -- Neurowear wants to geotag your <em>mood</em>. The folks that brought <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/19/tokyo-game-show-2011-wrap-up/">animated cat ears</a> to the human race is now using NeuroSky's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/22/neurosky-shows-off-upcoming-mindwave-headset-other-new-chip-app/">brainwave-reading headgear</a> to suss out your emotional state and share it with your friends. We dropped in on the group at Tokyo Game Show to take a look at an early prototype. After strapping a familiar Mindwave mobile headset to this editor's skull, a companion iPhone app sprung to life, reading off relaxation levels and assigning cartoon faces to the user's mood. The reading could then be recorded on a map, tagging how the user felt at a given location and time and allowing them to share that information with their friends. Had a great time at a new coffee shop? Now you can prove it, and encourage your social contacts to join you. It's an interesting idea, but its still a long way from hitting the app store -- the demo we were given was only a concept app, and the geotagging portion of the demonstration was simulated. It may be awhile before you can tweet your feelings directly. Need another way to express yourself? Don't worry -- Nerosky is adding a brainwave controlled tail, dubbed Shippo, to its line of cranium controlled animal parts. Check it out (as well as our quick neurotagging demo) after the break.<br></p><div><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/neurowear-neuro-tagging-map-hands-on/">Neurowear neuro tagging map hands-on</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/neurowear-neuro-tagging-map-hands-on/#5304931"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/dsc02343_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/neurowear-neuro-tagging-map-hands-on/#5304930"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/dsc02341_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/neurowear-neuro-tagging-map-hands-on/#5304932"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/dsc02346_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/neurowear-neuro-tagging-map-hands-on/#5304933"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/dsc02349_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/neurowear-neuro-tagging-map-hands-on/#5304926"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/dsc02335_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></div><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/neurowear-wants-to-read-your-mind-geotag-your-feelings/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Neurowear wants to read your mind, geotag your feelings (video)</em></a></p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/misc/" rel="tag">Misc</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/neurowear-wants-to-read-your-mind-geotag-your-feelings/">Neurowear wants to read your mind, geotag your feelings (video)</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 05:47:00 EDT.

You wouldn't guess it from the initial upgrade rate, however. Both ChartBoost and Chitika have determined that about 15 percent of iOS data traffic was already coming from Apple's latest release within its first 24 hours of availability -- not bad, considering that it took Android 4.0 roughly <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/01/ice-cream-sandwich-now-on16-percent-of-android-devices/">eight months</a> to reach a similar ratio and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/12/ios-5-review/">iOS 5</a> about five days to hit 20 percent. ChartBoost adds that iPhone owners were the quickest to upgrade, which is only logical when the iPhone 4S gets <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/12/psa-which-ios-6-features-can-my-device-run/">the most new features</a>. The contrast between Android and iOS was entirely expected, knowing Apple's limited hardware pool and reduced carrier oversight. We're more interested in the differences between iOS versions: they suggest that whatever advantages people see in iOS 6, as well as a widespread over-the-air update system, have been enough to spur on many early adopters.</p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/portable-audio-video/" rel="tag">Portable Audio/Video</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/tablets/" rel="tag">Tablets</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/ios-6-becomes-15-percent-of-apple-mobile-device-traffic-in-24h/">iOS 6 becomes 15 percent of Apple mobile device traffic within 24 hours</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 05:06:00 EDT.

Only it's not what you think. While Cellcom is indeed picking up the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/18/apple-iphone-5-review/">iPhone 5</a> soon, its major device launch <em>this</em> week is the HTC Desire 4G LTE, its rebranding of Verizon's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/06/droid-incredible-4g-lte-review/">Droid Incredible 4G LTE</a>. Other than the lack of Big Red badging and apps, it's a match for the mid-tier Android 4.0 handset on the larger (and shared) network. Buying one will even cost the same $150 on contract, or $420 at full price. Much to our relief, though, Cellcom isn't leaving us with one 4G phone per platform. The provider should start selling a relabeled Motorola <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/31/motorola-droid-razr-maxx-review/">Droid RAZR MAXX</a>, the $200 RAZR MAXX 4G LTE, at an unspecified point in the near future. Let's hope for better timing with the second wave of releases.</p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/cellcom-carries-htc-desire-4g-lte-as-its-first-lte-phone/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Cellcom carries HTC Desire 4G LTE as its first LTE phone September 21st, hopes you'll notice</em></a></p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/" rel="tag">Cellphones</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/wireless/" rel="tag">Wireless</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/" rel="tag">Mobile</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/cellcom-carries-htc-desire-4g-lte-as-its-first-lte-phone/">Cellcom carries HTC Desire 4G LTE as its first LTE phone September 21st, hopes you'll notice</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 04:35:00 EDT.

In addition to the headset's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/20/sony-protoypte-sr-spotted-at-tgs-2012/">substitutional reality prototype</a>, the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/11/sony-hmz-t2-price-release-date-japan/">standard model</a> stakes claim to almost a fifth of PlayStation's demo area. With all the local buzz, we decided to weigh in on how the $900 headgear shapes up as a gaming display. The answer? Heavily. Out of necessity, the HMZ-T2 crams the majority of its hardware in front of the users eyeballs, bearing most of its weight on the nose. Over extended gaming sessions, we could see this becoming uncomfortable -- and indeed, in our short time with the device we found our neck relaxing, begging to give in to the weight of the device. As silly as hung-head gaming might appear, however, the visual effect certainly does the trick -- creating the illusion of a large 3D television 4-6 feet in front of the user. It didn't add anything to <em>Hot Shots Golf 6</em> in terms of gameplay or experience, but it certainly comes in a more compact form than a full size television. The fancy headgear could surely be a boon for gamers living in a tight space, but folks with room (and cash) to spare are probably better off with a proper flat screen. On the other hand, visors are <em>way</em> more <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/30/sony-hmz-t2-3d-display-heads-in-video/">futuristic looking</a>. Don't believe us?

It even has a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/31/2nd-generation-razer-blade-gtx-660m/">laptop</a> geared expressly towards the serious pixel pusher. But, you might be surprised to learn it's also in the software business. The latest member of its burgeoning application family is the Razer Game Booster. Based largely on IObit's app of the same name, the new downloadable utility will crank your rig to 11. There are three basic features, the most important being Game Mode which, with the click of a button, shutsdown unessential services and programs to keep your PC focused on the task at hand. (We assume that involves killing something or other with a large weapon.) There's also a calibration guide that ensures your drivers are up to date and your essential gaming files are properly defragged. Last is Share Mode, which allows you to take screen shots or capture live audio and video to preserve your accomplishments. For now Razer Game Booster is in private beta, but you can request an invite at the source link. And don't miss the PR and video after the break.</p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/razer-game-booster-enters-closed-beta/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Razer Game Booster enters closed beta, ready to fine tune your rig (video)</em></a></p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/" rel="tag">Gaming</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/software/" rel="tag">Software</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/razer-game-booster-enters-closed-beta/">Razer Game Booster enters closed beta, ready to fine tune your rig (video)</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 03:09:00 EDT.

Starting October 26th, the hardware will be free for new <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/12/bt-infinity-speed-bump/">Infinity broadband</a> subscribers who ink contracts that are one year or longer. Instead of relying on cable, the Humax-built device uses both aerial and internet connections to deliver content from more than 100 digital TV and radio channels including Channels 4 and 5, the BBC and ITV. With the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/IPTV/">IPTV</a> box, users can sift through content that's aired in the past seven days, watch on-demand programs and record up to 300 hours of standard definition television or 125 hours of high-def video to a built-in 500GB hard drive. Current <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/21/bt-likely-to-write-off-onlive-cash/">British Telecom</a> subscribers pining for the subsidized box will be able to get their own for a &pound;49 activation fee and a &pound;6.95 delivery charge. Those eager for the gratis set-top solution will be able to order it online starting October 19th if they register interest with BT's website beforehand.

Also good news for those suffering through worn-out home buttons is an integrated metal support this time around, which may help extend its lifespan and make replacing it easier when it does expire. Beyond that, a 28nm Qualcomm <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/mdm9615">MDM9615M</a> chip is handling LTE, HSPA+, EV-Do Rev B and TD-SCMA connectivity, while the new metal back casing barely outweighs the back glass from the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/13/iphone-4s-gets-teardown-treatment-siri-gasps-in-terror/">iPhone 4S</a>.

Researchers from the University of Melbourne and University College, London, have now developed the "first working quantum bit based on a single atom of silicon." By measuring and manipulating the magnetic orientation, or spin, of an electron bound to a phosphorus atom embedded in a silicon chip, the scientists were able to both read and write information, forming a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/qubit">qubit</a>, the basic unit of data for quantum computing.</p><p> The team used a silicon transistor, which detects the electron's spin and captures its energy when the spin's direction is "up." Once the electron is in the transistor, scientists can change its spin state any way they choose, effectively "writing" information and giving them control of the quantum bit. The next step will be combing two qubits into a logic step, with the ultimate goal being a full-fledged quantum computer capable of crunching numbers, cracking encryption codes and modeling molecules that would put even supercomputers to shame.

The <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/30/razer-battlefield-3-aviator-headsets/">original unit</a> first broke from cover just ahead of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/event/e3-2012/">E3</a>, but on that particular show floor, the aviator-inspired set of cans was sporting the blue and orange hues consistent with its <em>Battlefield 3</em> branding. Here at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Tgs2012/">TGS</a>, we were able to take a closer look at the version that lacks a game-specific allegiance. The hardware is identical with the lone exception being the new paint scheme. If you're unfamiliar with the BlackShark, the headset does a stellar job of recalling classic pilot units complete with detachable boom mic for use with your PMP of choice. The $120 peripheral also features quite comfy heavily-padded, leather-esque earcups and the same material wraps the headband with a dash of bright green stitching -- all held over from the <em>BF3</em> model. We weren't able to test the audio quality on the show floor, so until our review unit arrives, consult the gallery below and the video that just past the break for a closer look. </p><div><p><strong>Gallery: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/razer-blackshark-gaming-headset-hands-on-0/">Razer BlackShark gaming headset hands-on</a></strong></p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/razer-blackshark-gaming-headset-hands-on-0/#5304572"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/dsc02264_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/razer-blackshark-gaming-headset-hands-on-0/#5304575"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/dsc02267_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/razer-blackshark-gaming-headset-hands-on-0/#5304574"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/dsc02266_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/razer-blackshark-gaming-headset-hands-on-0/#5304546"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/dsc02224_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/razer-blackshark-gaming-headset-hands-on-0/#5304549"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/dsc02234_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></div><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/razer-blackshark-gaming-headset-hands-on/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Razer BlackShark gaming headset hands-on (video)</em></a></p><p>Filed under: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/" rel="tag">Gaming</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/peripherals/" rel="tag">Peripherals</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/category/portable-audio-video/" rel="tag">Portable Audio/Video</a></p><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/razer-blackshark-gaming-headset-hands-on/">Razer BlackShark gaming headset hands-on (video)</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> on Fri, 21 Sep 2012 00:01:00 EDT.

              You've got to hand it to them, few companies do a product rollout better than Apple. Today's iPhone 5 debut is no exception, as we saw at the company's King Street store where eager Apple fans queued up around the corner onto Liberty St. awaiting their chance to fork over $199 (at least) for the newest hardware when the store opened its doors at 8 a.m. </p>
<p>Marcos Galofre, a 21-year-old Art Institute film student from Spain, was the first one in line.

But he managed to <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseScottOwen/status/248237285844336640" target="_blank">Tweet</a> about the experience. The mattress had fallen from the rooftop spa of the Setai Wall Street, about 30 stories up. <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/college-student-knocked-unconscious-falling-mattress-broad-st-article-1.1163143" target="_blank">Link</a> -via <a href="http://arbroath.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Arbroath</a></p></div><div class='chunk'>Neatorama<a href='http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/21/Super-Mario-Unipiper/>Super Mario Unipiper</a><p><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/_XPcj0GsQTU/0.jpg"> (<a href="http://youtu.be/_XPcj0GsQTU" target="_blank">YouTube link</a>)</p><p>Our old friend Brian Kidd, known as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/theunipiper" target="_blank">the Unipiper</a>, has a new video, and this time he channels Mario!

The Texas Secretary of State sent out of list of dead voters generated by cross-referencing federal Social Security deaths with state voting records. The only problem with this was that those dead voters didn't like it one bit. &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>At least one county registrar (Don Sumners of Harris County) refused to comply with instructions to delete thousands of names, based on his belief that the Social Security database is unreliable and/or that other mistakes were made.<br><br>He apparently believed this because, after getting notices informing them that they would not be allowed to vote, hundreds of the presumably dead contacted him to complain.<br><br>The state responded to Sumners' information calmly and rationally by changing its plans. What? No it didn't, it cut off Harris County's election funds in an effort to force it to purge the dead voters, whether the dead voters liked it or not. After some haggling, Sumners said he would purge voters whose families confirmed their deaths before the election, and the state agreed to restore funding (essentially backing down).<br><br>The four not-dead plaintiffs argue that there is no state-law authority for the purge and that because Texas has a history of voting-rights violations (not against the undead, but still), it was required by the federal Voting Rights Act to get pre-approval for the relevant rule change.</p></blockquote><p>Who will speak for the undead?

Here are just a few of the fattest kings and queens on record.</em></p><p><strong>1. Itey (ca. 1490 BCE)</strong></p><p><strong><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/647/52/52647/1348193715-0.jpg" alt="" data-width="572" data-height="468"><br></strong></p><p>Sort of an ancient Egyptian punch line, this corpulant queen ruled over the land of Punt, located somewhere in East Africa. So how exactly do we know of the great monarch's girth? Well, the Egyptian pharoah Hatshepsut launched a trade delegation to Punt, and carvings on the walls of her temple complex at Deir el-Bahri record the expedition. Itey is depicted as grossly obese and is even pictured standing next to a diminutive husband and a tiny donkey. Under the donkey, in a delightful bit of Egyptian humor, is the inscription "This donkey had to carry the queen." A beast of burden indeed.</p><p><strong>2. Eglon (ca. 1100 BCE)</strong></p><p><strong><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/647/52/52647/1348193715-1.jpg" alt="" data-width="600" data-height="626"><br></strong></p><p>According to the Bible, Eglon was the king of Moab (in modern Jordan) who united several tribes of highland and desert raiders to conquer the central Israelite tribes sometime in the 12th century BCE. An Israelite named Ehud gained the king's confidence, got him in a room alone, then killed him. Of course, the murder wasn' exactly a smooth operation. The Bible describes vividly that Eglon was so fat that Ehud couldn't retrieve his blade. Luckily, though, he managed to escape with little trouble. As he fled, Ehud told Eglon's servants that the king was using the restroom. The stench coming from the room must have been fairly run-of-the-mill, because by the time they went to check on their beloved king, Ehud had already rallied his followers and formed an army.</p><p><strong>3. Charles the Fat (Ruled 881-888)</strong></p><a name="more"></a><p><strong><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/647/52/52647/1348193715-2.jpg" alt="" data-width="551" data-height="586"><br></strong></p><p>Not many kings actually have "the Fat" added to their names. A series of fortuitous deaths and abdications in the late 870s and early 880s left Charles the ruler of almost all his great-grandfather Charlemagne's empire, encompassing most of modern-day France, Germany, and Italy. But Charles lacked the energy of his ancestor and namesake, possibly due in part to his obesity. During his reign Arab pirates raided Italy with impunity, and Charles couldn't even be bothered to fight Viking marauders in northwestern France (he found it easier to pay them to go away instead). And while the dreaded moniker does have a certain ring to it, Charles wasn't the only French king of notable girth -Louis VI (ruled 1108-1137) also earned the appelation "the Fat."</p><p><strong>4. George IV (Ruled 1820-1830)</strong></p><p><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/647/52/52647/1348193715-3.jpg" alt="George IV" width="600" data-width="600" data-height="778"></p><p>George IV became king of England in 1820 after serving as prince regent while his father, George III, was alive but incompetent to rule. Apparently, though, the plush lifestyle being "Defender of the Faith" provided him seems to have only whetted his appetite. Known as a gambler, a drinker, and a laudanum addict, among other things, George IV enjoyed the dubious distinction of being far and away the fattest king in English history. His favorite breakfast was two roast pigeons, three beefsteaks, a bottle of white wine, a glass of champagne, two glasses of port, and one of brandy ...after all, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.</p><p><strong>5. Farouk (Ruled 1936-1952)</strong></p><p><strong><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/647/52/52647/1348193715-4.jpg" alt="" data-width="541" data-height="550"><br></strong></p><p>Farouk, the last knig of Egypt with any real power, was crowned in 1936 and proceeded to live it up. He owned numerous palaces in Europe, hundreds of cars, and thousands of horses. But financing the royal lifestyle turned out to be a bit of a problem, so Farouk turned Egypt into even more of a kleptocracy than it had previously been. He was even renowned as a skilled pickpocket and was known to steal valuable items while on state visits to other countries (incuding a priceless pocket watch from Winston Churchill and a ceremonial sword from the shah of Iran!). In the end, Farouk was overthrown by a military coup in 1952 and briefly replaced with his newborn son, Faud. But after a few months of infant rule, Egypt cleverly scrapped the monarchy thing altogether in favor of a slightly less corrupt military dictatorship under Gamal Abdel Nassar (which degenerated into an arguably more corrupt system than Farouk could have dreamed possible). As for ex-king Farouk, he lived out the rest of his life in exile. Eating being one of his few pleasures, he died in 1965, at the age of 45, after gorging himself at the table. He weighed out at 300 pounds.</p><hr><p><img src="http://static.neatorama.com/img4/mf-forbidden-knowledge.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="191"></p><p>From mental_floss' book <a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/store/product.php?productid=16133&amp;cat=3&amp;page=1">Forbidden Knowledge: A Wickedly Smart Guide to History's Naughtiest Bits</a>, published in Neatorama with permission.</p><p>Be sure to visit <a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/">mental_floss</a>' extremely entertaining website and blog!</p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/"><img src="http://static.neatorama.com/img4/mf-logo-310.gif" alt="" width="310" height="48" border="0"></a></p><!--end_raw--></div><div class='chunk'>Neatorama<a href='http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/21/The-Vampires-at-Sea-Cruise-and-Other-Wacky-Cruises/>Vampires at Sea and Other Wacky Cruises</a><p><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/637/52/52637/1348183003-0.jpg" alt="cruise" width="600" data-width="600" data-height="396"></p><p>Do you love the <em>Twilight</em> series?

In fact, not only do three of his brothers act, but one of his sisters is a nun who did a full U.S. tour of a one-woman show about St. Catherine of Siena. All in all, Bill&rsquo;s parents, a mail room clerk and a lumber salesman, saw five of their nine children become actors. Bill&rsquo;s brother Brian is even the one who got him involved in the famous improv troupe The Second City.</p><h3>His Early Career Interests Were All Over the Place</h3><p>In high school, Bill was the lead singer of a rock band. When he went to college, he wanted to be a doctor and studied premed before he dropped out &ndash;his school eventually awarded him an honorary Doctorate in 2007. Shortly after college, he was arrested at Chicago&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Hare Airport for trying to bring 9 pounds of pot onto an airplane, which he was accused of intending to sell.</p><h3>He Was On the Original SNL</h3><p>No, Bill Murray wasn&rsquo;t on the first season of NBC&rsquo;s <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, but in 1975, he was cast on ABC&rsquo;s variety show also called <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, which was hosted by Howard Cosell. That was the same year SNL started and after the ABC program was cancelled one season in, Murray was hired to work on the much more successful NBC sketch show. He continued to work on the show for three seasons from 1877 until 1980.</p><h3>His Early Movie Career Was Incredibly Impressive</h3><a name="more"></a><p>Bill&rsquo;s first starring role was in <em>Meatballs</em>, then he starred as Hunter S. Thompson in <em>Where the Buffalo Roam</em>, and then he was in <em>Caddyshack</em>, <em>Stripes</em> and <em>Tootsie</em>. He did so well that he was even invited to be the first guest on NBC&rsquo;s <em>Late Night With David Letterman</em> and when David started to host the <em>Late Show </em>on CBS, he invited Bill to be his first guest there as well.</p><p>Interestingly, one of his most popular roles, that of Peter Venkman in <em>Ghostbusters</em>, was one that he only participated in as part of a deal to get Columbia Pictures to provide financing for his film adaptation of the novel <em>The Razor&rsquo;s Edge</em>. Of course, given that you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of his version of <em>The Razor&rsquo;s Edge</em>, you probably already know how well that one did.</p><p>While every actor is bound to make a few flops, Bill was highly invested in the movie and he took its failure pretty hard. In fact, he took the next four years off of acting, with the only exception being a small cameo in <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em>. During that time he studied philosophy and history.</p><h3>He&rsquo;s Good At Comebacks</h3><p><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/652/52/52652/1348204189-1.jpg" alt="" data-width="434" data-height="599"></p><p>Image Via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BillMurraySept10TIFF.jpg">gdcgraphics</a> [Wikipedia]</p><p>After that short four year break, Bill returned to star in four more classics, <em>Scrooged</em>, <em>Ghostbusters II</em>, <em>What About Bob?</em> And <em>Groundhog Day</em>. Unfortunately, after that he had another slump, though he at least didn&rsquo;t quit acting temporarily like he did after his first failure. Instead, he continued trying new roles out until he received great acclaim for his role in <em>Rushmore</em>. Inspired, he decided to start taking more dramatic roles, leading him to star in films such as <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em> and <em>Lost in Translation </em>&ndash;which he says was his favorite role to date. As any Murray fan will tell you though, most of his dramatic roles are great because they still have such touching funny scenes, which is where his comedic background really helps. In fact, that&rsquo;s probably why he won a Golden Globe, a BAFTA Award and an Independent Spirit Award for his work in <em>Lost in Translation</em>.</p><p>After filming two more popular dramatic films, <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</em> and <em>Broken Flowers</em>, he took another break from acting, this time just to give himself time to relax. While he played a few cameos during the next few years, he didn&rsquo;t play a lead role again until <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em>.</p><h3>He Could Have Been in a Lot More Great Films</h3><p>One of the things that makes Mr. Murray so darn cool is the fact that he&rsquo;s so detached from Hollywood. In fact, he doesn&rsquo;t even have an agent or a manager and only gets offers for scripts from people who leave phone messages on a special telephone line that he rarely checks. Unfortunately, that also means he sometimes misses out on great roles that he really wanted to be involved with. For example, he could have done the voice of Sulley in <em>Monsters, Inc.</em>, played Frank Ginsburg in <em>Little Miss Sunshine</em> and Willy Wonka in <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>. The one he regrets the most though was missing out on the opportunity to play Eddie Valiant in <em>Who Framed Roger Rabit</em>.</p><h3>He Really Does Love Golf</h3><p><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/652/52/52652/1348204189-2.jpg" alt="" data-width="290" data-height="600"></p><p>Image Via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bill_Murray_%2899082849%29_cropped.jpg">Steve Jurvetson</a> [Wikipedia]</p><p><em>Caddyshack</em> was actually a perfect fit movie for Bill, as he is an avid golfer. He even had ample experience with his role, as he worked as a golf caddy throughout high school &ndash;sure he wasn&rsquo;t the groundskeeper, but I&rsquo;m willing to bet that he got to know the groundskeeper of his local course.</p><p>These days Bill plays in many celebrity tournaments, is featured playing golf in a number of movies, including Zombieland, and he even wrote a book called <em>Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf</em> about his love for the game. He also starred in a Comedy Central series with his brothers called &ldquo;The Sweet Spot&rdquo; that was all about them playing golf. He and his brothers also own a restaurant near St. Augustine that is appropriately named Caddy Shack.</p><p>Golf isn&rsquo;t the only game he&rsquo;s passionate about though. Bill is a part-owner of a number of minor league baseball team, including the St. Paul Saints, the Charleston RiverDogs, Hudson Valley Renegades, and the Brockton Rox.</p><h3>Musicians Really Love Him</h3><p>Bill Murray is one of the only actors who multiple bands have written songs about. In fact, Wikipedia lists eleven songs inspired by Bill and chances are that there are more that were never added. While most of the bands are small indie or punk groups, popular group Gorillaz released a single and video called &ldquo;Bill Murray&rdquo; in 2007.</p><p>So remember, no matter how you feel about his stance on <em>Ghostbusters III</em>, Bill&rsquo;s still responsible for a lot of great things that we can all appreciate. So enjoy a very Happy Birthday Mr. Murray!</p><p>Sources: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Murray">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.ranker.com/list/the-7-greatest-_real_-bill-murray-stories-ever-told/kristin-wong?page=2#YGAbmPoBRXODSmqL.99">Ranker</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/20/magazine/the-rumpled-anarchy-of-bill-murray.html?src=pm">New York Times</a> and <a href="http://www.salon.com/2001/02/06/murray_3/">Salon</a></p></div><div class='chunk'>Neatorama<a href='http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/21/Pig-Saves-Drowning-Goat/>Pig Saves Drowning Goat</a><p><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/g7WjrvG1GMk/0.jpg"></p><p>(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=g7WjrvG1GMk#!">Video Link</a>)</p><p>These two little guys live together in a petting zoo and when the pig saw the baby goat drowning, he dove in to save him and pushed him to the shallow part of the lake.

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been reading this blog for a while, you might have noticed that the setting for just about all of my posts is either Newburgh or New York City. There are never posts about, say, a summer vacation in Paris or even a long weekend in San Francisco. Yes, Evan and I did go to a friend&rsquo;s wedding in Arizona <a href="http://www.doorsixteen.com/2009/10/28/to-arizona-and-back-in-seven-photos/">three years ago</a>, but aside from that&mdash;I am still right here, where I always was.</p>
<p>I was born <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinebeck_%28village%29,_New_York">about 100 miles north of NYC</a>, and in the 37 years since, I&rsquo;ve moved up and down that 100 mile span and haven&rsquo;t really looked beyond. I did spend some time (about 6 months total) in Los Angeles in my early 20s while in the throes of a long-distance relationship, but New York&mdash;specifically the lower and mid-Hudson Valley region into NYC&mdash;has <em>always</em> been home.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because my mother is an immigrant or because my father is a born and bred New Yorker, but I&rsquo;ve just always had this sense that I&rsquo;m supposed to be here. Like New York was chosen for me. I love New York <em>so much</em>. It&rsquo;s hard for me to describe how emotional this city makes me, <a href="http://www.doorsixteen.com/2009/03/12/manhattan/">though this clip spells it out pretty well</a>. I took the photo at the top of this post over the weekend when we were driving down from Newburgh. <em>Every time</em> I see that skyline, I get misty-eyed. Every single time. I don&rsquo;t remember who said it (maybe Woody Allen), but I&rsquo;ve heard that New York is a place that makes people nostalgic for the present. That&rsquo;s so, so true.</p>
<p>The other thing about New York City is that because there&rsquo;s always so much going on here and because the population is incredibly diverse, it&rsquo;s easy to start to feel like you&rsquo;re living in a microcosm of the entire world. In a single afternoon you can have interactions with people from a dozen different cultures all over the planet. You can walk 10 blocks from a midtown office building and be in a grassy oasis at Central Park. Hop on a subway, and in under an hour you&rsquo;re at Coney Island looking at the Atlantic Ocean. I think having so much here can tend to tamp down what might otherwise be a natural wanderlust. You get comfortable. New York is safe. This city makes sense.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t travel much growing up. I&rsquo;ve never really talked to my parents about this, but I can only assume it was because of money&mdash;they were both artists, and there were a lot of us kids between the two of them. I don&rsquo;t know how it would have been possible! So we didn&rsquo;t go to Disney World or Hawaii or whatever it was other kids in school were doing during their vacations. The summer before I turned 9, though, I went to Sweden with my mother. Just the two of us! We stayed with my aunt and uncle and spent time with my grandmother, who was still living in the tiny Stockholm apartment my mother grew up in. Even though that trip was almost 30 years ago, I remember it <em>so</em> vividly&mdash;to the point that I can still recall a pair of lace-up canvas shoes my mother bought me while we were there, and how the cobblestone streets felt through their soles. I remember going to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088015/">Ronja R&ouml;vardotter</a> in the movie theater, and somehow understanding enough for it to not matter that there of course weren&rsquo;t any English subtitles. The popcorn came in a cone with Mickey Mouse (excuse me, I mean <em>Musse Pigg</em>) on it.</p>
<p>And that was kind of the end of the idea of traveling for pleasure for me. Between work and school and more work and no money and more work and work and work and general exhaustion and eventually illness, I developed a weird kind of fear of being away from home. I don&rsquo;t know how to drive (I&rsquo;ve never driven, in fact&mdash;I&rsquo;m terrified of that, too), so I don&rsquo;t have that instinct to just <em>get up and go</em>. The prospect of planning a trip is fraught with anxieties over having to make decisions based on things I know nothing about. It&rsquo;s totally overwhelming. I start thinking about getting lost. About being robbed. About not understanding signs. About becoming so caught up in fear that I&rsquo;m unable to ask for help. I run through all of these possibilities in my head, and then conclude that I&rsquo;d be happier just hanging out in New York. So I stay put.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, I&rsquo;ve always kind of thought of myself as being a &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; person. I&rsquo;m interested in art and design and music and books and movies from all over the world, and I&rsquo;ve never shied away from meeting people from all different backgrounds. I certainly didn&rsquo;t grow up in a household where nationalism was encouraged, either. By all rights, I <em>should</em> be a world traveler. I <em>should</em> have that wanderlust. I guess it&rsquo;s just a lifetime of fear and procrastination that&rsquo;s suppressed those impulses.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to take a major step in a week and half, though: I&rsquo;m getting on a plane (uncharacteristically, I&rsquo;m <em>not</em> afraid of flying!) by myself and going to London for 8 days. I&rsquo;m going to visit a very good friend of mine. He&rsquo;s a born Londoner who&rsquo;s traveled all over the world and lived on two continents&mdash;really the opposite of me in that regard! I intentionally haven&rsquo;t made <em>any</em> plans in advance because I know that will only cause me to feel anxious, so I&rsquo;m just going to let the trip happen. I&rsquo;ll figure it out as I go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a renewed passport, a suitcase with wheels and a travel-sized bottle of hairspray, so I&rsquo;m pretty much ready to go. I&rsquo;m excited! I&rsquo;m still nervous about getting lost and being eaten by rabid British squirrels, but deep down I know everything will be fine. Let&rsquo;s do this thing, world.</p></div><div class='chunk'>Door Sixteen<a href='http://www.doorsixteen.com/2012/08/21/this-must-be-the-place/>This must be the place.</a><p><br><span>Talking Heads / &ldquo;This Must Be The Place (Na&iuml;ve Melody)&rdquo; / Directed by <a href="http://davidbyrne.com/">David Byrne</a></span></p>

But he managed to <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseScottOwen/status/248237285844336640" target="_blank">Tweet</a> about the experience. The mattress had fallen from the rooftop spa of the Setai Wall Street, about 30 stories up. <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/college-student-knocked-unconscious-falling-mattress-broad-st-article-1.1163143" target="_blank">Link</a> -via <a href="http://arbroath.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Arbroath</a></p></div><div class='chunk'>Neatorama<a href='http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/21/Super-Mario-Unipiper/>Super Mario Unipiper</a><p><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/_XPcj0GsQTU/0.jpg"> (<a href="http://youtu.be/_XPcj0GsQTU" target="_blank">YouTube link</a>)</p><p>Our old friend Brian Kidd, known as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/theunipiper" target="_blank">the Unipiper</a>, has a new video, and this time he channels Mario!

The Texas Secretary of State sent out of list of dead voters generated by cross-referencing federal Social Security deaths with state voting records. The only problem with this was that those dead voters didn't like it one bit. &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>At least one county registrar (Don Sumners of Harris County) refused to comply with instructions to delete thousands of names, based on his belief that the Social Security database is unreliable and/or that other mistakes were made.<br><br>He apparently believed this because, after getting notices informing them that they would not be allowed to vote, hundreds of the presumably dead contacted him to complain.<br><br>The state responded to Sumners' information calmly and rationally by changing its plans. What? No it didn't, it cut off Harris County's election funds in an effort to force it to purge the dead voters, whether the dead voters liked it or not. After some haggling, Sumners said he would purge voters whose families confirmed their deaths before the election, and the state agreed to restore funding (essentially backing down).<br><br>The four not-dead plaintiffs argue that there is no state-law authority for the purge and that because Texas has a history of voting-rights violations (not against the undead, but still), it was required by the federal Voting Rights Act to get pre-approval for the relevant rule change.</p></blockquote><p>Who will speak for the undead?

Here are just a few of the fattest kings and queens on record.</em></p><p><strong>1. Itey (ca. 1490 BCE)</strong></p><p><strong><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/647/52/52647/1348193715-0.jpg" alt="" data-width="572" data-height="468"><br></strong></p><p>Sort of an ancient Egyptian punch line, this corpulant queen ruled over the land of Punt, located somewhere in East Africa. So how exactly do we know of the great monarch's girth? Well, the Egyptian pharoah Hatshepsut launched a trade delegation to Punt, and carvings on the walls of her temple complex at Deir el-Bahri record the expedition. Itey is depicted as grossly obese and is even pictured standing next to a diminutive husband and a tiny donkey. Under the donkey, in a delightful bit of Egyptian humor, is the inscription "This donkey had to carry the queen." A beast of burden indeed.</p><p><strong>2. Eglon (ca. 1100 BCE)</strong></p><p><strong><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/647/52/52647/1348193715-1.jpg" alt="" data-width="600" data-height="626"><br></strong></p><p>According to the Bible, Eglon was the king of Moab (in modern Jordan) who united several tribes of highland and desert raiders to conquer the central Israelite tribes sometime in the 12th century BCE. An Israelite named Ehud gained the king's confidence, got him in a room alone, then killed him. Of course, the murder wasn' exactly a smooth operation. The Bible describes vividly that Eglon was so fat that Ehud couldn't retrieve his blade. Luckily, though, he managed to escape with little trouble. As he fled, Ehud told Eglon's servants that the king was using the restroom. The stench coming from the room must have been fairly run-of-the-mill, because by the time they went to check on their beloved king, Ehud had already rallied his followers and formed an army.</p><p><strong>3. Charles the Fat (Ruled 881-888)</strong></p><a name="more"></a><p><strong><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/647/52/52647/1348193715-2.jpg" alt="" data-width="551" data-height="586"><br></strong></p><p>Not many kings actually have "the Fat" added to their names. A series of fortuitous deaths and abdications in the late 870s and early 880s left Charles the ruler of almost all his great-grandfather Charlemagne's empire, encompassing most of modern-day France, Germany, and Italy. But Charles lacked the energy of his ancestor and namesake, possibly due in part to his obesity. During his reign Arab pirates raided Italy with impunity, and Charles couldn't even be bothered to fight Viking marauders in northwestern France (he found it easier to pay them to go away instead). And while the dreaded moniker does have a certain ring to it, Charles wasn't the only French king of notable girth -Louis VI (ruled 1108-1137) also earned the appelation "the Fat."</p><p><strong>4. George IV (Ruled 1820-1830)</strong></p><p><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/647/52/52647/1348193715-3.jpg" alt="George IV" width="600" data-width="600" data-height="778"></p><p>George IV became king of England in 1820 after serving as prince regent while his father, George III, was alive but incompetent to rule. Apparently, though, the plush lifestyle being "Defender of the Faith" provided him seems to have only whetted his appetite. Known as a gambler, a drinker, and a laudanum addict, among other things, George IV enjoyed the dubious distinction of being far and away the fattest king in English history. His favorite breakfast was two roast pigeons, three beefsteaks, a bottle of white wine, a glass of champagne, two glasses of port, and one of brandy ...after all, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.</p><p><strong>5. Farouk (Ruled 1936-1952)</strong></p><p><strong><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/647/52/52647/1348193715-4.jpg" alt="" data-width="541" data-height="550"><br></strong></p><p>Farouk, the last knig of Egypt with any real power, was crowned in 1936 and proceeded to live it up. He owned numerous palaces in Europe, hundreds of cars, and thousands of horses. But financing the royal lifestyle turned out to be a bit of a problem, so Farouk turned Egypt into even more of a kleptocracy than it had previously been. He was even renowned as a skilled pickpocket and was known to steal valuable items while on state visits to other countries (incuding a priceless pocket watch from Winston Churchill and a ceremonial sword from the shah of Iran!). In the end, Farouk was overthrown by a military coup in 1952 and briefly replaced with his newborn son, Faud. But after a few months of infant rule, Egypt cleverly scrapped the monarchy thing altogether in favor of a slightly less corrupt military dictatorship under Gamal Abdel Nassar (which degenerated into an arguably more corrupt system than Farouk could have dreamed possible). As for ex-king Farouk, he lived out the rest of his life in exile. Eating being one of his few pleasures, he died in 1965, at the age of 45, after gorging himself at the table. He weighed out at 300 pounds.</p><hr><p><img src="http://static.neatorama.com/img4/mf-forbidden-knowledge.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="191"></p><p>From mental_floss' book <a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/store/product.php?productid=16133&amp;cat=3&amp;page=1">Forbidden Knowledge: A Wickedly Smart Guide to History's Naughtiest Bits</a>, published in Neatorama with permission.</p><p>Be sure to visit <a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/">mental_floss</a>' extremely entertaining website and blog!</p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/"><img src="http://static.neatorama.com/img4/mf-logo-310.gif" alt="" width="310" height="48" border="0"></a></p><!--end_raw--></div><div class='chunk'>Neatorama<a href='http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/21/The-Vampires-at-Sea-Cruise-and-Other-Wacky-Cruises/>Vampires at Sea and Other Wacky Cruises</a><p><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/637/52/52637/1348183003-0.jpg" alt="cruise" width="600" data-width="600" data-height="396"></p><p>Do you love the <em>Twilight</em> series?

In fact, not only do three of his brothers act, but one of his sisters is a nun who did a full U.S. tour of a one-woman show about St. Catherine of Siena. All in all, Bill&rsquo;s parents, a mail room clerk and a lumber salesman, saw five of their nine children become actors. Bill&rsquo;s brother Brian is even the one who got him involved in the famous improv troupe The Second City.</p><h3>His Early Career Interests Were All Over the Place</h3><p>In high school, Bill was the lead singer of a rock band. When he went to college, he wanted to be a doctor and studied premed before he dropped out &ndash;his school eventually awarded him an honorary Doctorate in 2007. Shortly after college, he was arrested at Chicago&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Hare Airport for trying to bring 9 pounds of pot onto an airplane, which he was accused of intending to sell.</p><h3>He Was On the Original SNL</h3><p>No, Bill Murray wasn&rsquo;t on the first season of NBC&rsquo;s <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, but in 1975, he was cast on ABC&rsquo;s variety show also called <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, which was hosted by Howard Cosell. That was the same year SNL started and after the ABC program was cancelled one season in, Murray was hired to work on the much more successful NBC sketch show. He continued to work on the show for three seasons from 1877 until 1980.</p><h3>His Early Movie Career Was Incredibly Impressive</h3><a name="more"></a><p>Bill&rsquo;s first starring role was in <em>Meatballs</em>, then he starred as Hunter S. Thompson in <em>Where the Buffalo Roam</em>, and then he was in <em>Caddyshack</em>, <em>Stripes</em> and <em>Tootsie</em>. He did so well that he was even invited to be the first guest on NBC&rsquo;s <em>Late Night With David Letterman</em> and when David started to host the <em>Late Show </em>on CBS, he invited Bill to be his first guest there as well.</p><p>Interestingly, one of his most popular roles, that of Peter Venkman in <em>Ghostbusters</em>, was one that he only participated in as part of a deal to get Columbia Pictures to provide financing for his film adaptation of the novel <em>The Razor&rsquo;s Edge</em>. Of course, given that you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of his version of <em>The Razor&rsquo;s Edge</em>, you probably already know how well that one did.</p><p>While every actor is bound to make a few flops, Bill was highly invested in the movie and he took its failure pretty hard. In fact, he took the next four years off of acting, with the only exception being a small cameo in <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em>. During that time he studied philosophy and history.</p><h3>He&rsquo;s Good At Comebacks</h3><p><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/652/52/52652/1348204189-1.jpg" alt="" data-width="434" data-height="599"></p><p>Image Via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BillMurraySept10TIFF.jpg">gdcgraphics</a> [Wikipedia]</p><p>After that short four year break, Bill returned to star in four more classics, <em>Scrooged</em>, <em>Ghostbusters II</em>, <em>What About Bob?</em> And <em>Groundhog Day</em>. Unfortunately, after that he had another slump, though he at least didn&rsquo;t quit acting temporarily like he did after his first failure. Instead, he continued trying new roles out until he received great acclaim for his role in <em>Rushmore</em>. Inspired, he decided to start taking more dramatic roles, leading him to star in films such as <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em> and <em>Lost in Translation </em>&ndash;which he says was his favorite role to date. As any Murray fan will tell you though, most of his dramatic roles are great because they still have such touching funny scenes, which is where his comedic background really helps. In fact, that&rsquo;s probably why he won a Golden Globe, a BAFTA Award and an Independent Spirit Award for his work in <em>Lost in Translation</em>.</p><p>After filming two more popular dramatic films, <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</em> and <em>Broken Flowers</em>, he took another break from acting, this time just to give himself time to relax. While he played a few cameos during the next few years, he didn&rsquo;t play a lead role again until <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em>.</p><h3>He Could Have Been in a Lot More Great Films</h3><p>One of the things that makes Mr. Murray so darn cool is the fact that he&rsquo;s so detached from Hollywood. In fact, he doesn&rsquo;t even have an agent or a manager and only gets offers for scripts from people who leave phone messages on a special telephone line that he rarely checks. Unfortunately, that also means he sometimes misses out on great roles that he really wanted to be involved with. For example, he could have done the voice of Sulley in <em>Monsters, Inc.</em>, played Frank Ginsburg in <em>Little Miss Sunshine</em> and Willy Wonka in <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>. The one he regrets the most though was missing out on the opportunity to play Eddie Valiant in <em>Who Framed Roger Rabit</em>.</p><h3>He Really Does Love Golf</h3><p><img src="http://uploads.neatorama.com/images/posts/652/52/52652/1348204189-2.jpg" alt="" data-width="290" data-height="600"></p><p>Image Via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bill_Murray_%2899082849%29_cropped.jpg">Steve Jurvetson</a> [Wikipedia]</p><p><em>Caddyshack</em> was actually a perfect fit movie for Bill, as he is an avid golfer. He even had ample experience with his role, as he worked as a golf caddy throughout high school &ndash;sure he wasn&rsquo;t the groundskeeper, but I&rsquo;m willing to bet that he got to know the groundskeeper of his local course.</p><p>These days Bill plays in many celebrity tournaments, is featured playing golf in a number of movies, including Zombieland, and he even wrote a book called <em>Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf</em> about his love for the game. He also starred in a Comedy Central series with his brothers called &ldquo;The Sweet Spot&rdquo; that was all about them playing golf. He and his brothers also own a restaurant near St. Augustine that is appropriately named Caddy Shack.</p><p>Golf isn&rsquo;t the only game he&rsquo;s passionate about though. Bill is a part-owner of a number of minor league baseball team, including the St. Paul Saints, the Charleston RiverDogs, Hudson Valley Renegades, and the Brockton Rox.</p><h3>Musicians Really Love Him</h3><p>Bill Murray is one of the only actors who multiple bands have written songs about. In fact, Wikipedia lists eleven songs inspired by Bill and chances are that there are more that were never added. While most of the bands are small indie or punk groups, popular group Gorillaz released a single and video called &ldquo;Bill Murray&rdquo; in 2007.</p><p>So remember, no matter how you feel about his stance on <em>Ghostbusters III</em>, Bill&rsquo;s still responsible for a lot of great things that we can all appreciate. So enjoy a very Happy Birthday Mr. Murray!</p><p>Sources: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Murray">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.ranker.com/list/the-7-greatest-_real_-bill-murray-stories-ever-told/kristin-wong?page=2#YGAbmPoBRXODSmqL.99">Ranker</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/20/magazine/the-rumpled-anarchy-of-bill-murray.html?src=pm">New York Times</a> and <a href="http://www.salon.com/2001/02/06/murray_3/">Salon</a></p></div><div class='chunk'>Neatorama<a href='http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/21/Pig-Saves-Drowning-Goat/>Pig Saves Drowning Goat</a><p><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/g7WjrvG1GMk/0.jpg"></p><p>(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=g7WjrvG1GMk#!">Video Link</a>)</p><p>These two little guys live together in a petting zoo and when the pig saw the baby goat drowning, he dove in to save him and pushed him to the shallow part of the lake.

You see, this company&rsquo;s calling card is helping some of the largest players in the corporate space design their future. Whether it&rsquo;s helping them envision a new direction, or working to make the C-suite innovative as well as productive, this company is literally in the business of problem solving, and your role will be creating the digital experiences that help their customers to help themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Gun Profile:</strong></p>
<p>You have deep empathy for those you design for &mdash; and those you design with. You are highly collaborative, working side-by-side with other designers, strategists, developers, production artists, and project managers.&nbsp; You love the iterative nature of how products get built and have a passion for exploring ways to continually improve those products.&nbsp; As someone who has built online tools and applications before, you know how to translate complicated processes into elegant and easy-to-use interfaces. You&rsquo;ve got a strong intellectual interest in HCI and a decent grasp of HTML, CSS and Javascript (for prototyping purposes).</p>
<p><strong>Nitty Gritty:</strong></p>
<p>As the main advocate for interaction design within this company, it will be up to you to champion the end users and ensure that they receive the seamless experience they deserve. As the lead Interaction Designer, you will form a UX plan based on user goals, sketch and define the primary interfaces, create prototypes, and stay on top of trends to keep the site current in terms of UI and technology. You&rsquo;ll be joining the product development team, working closely with engineers and product managers through all stages of the development process.</p>
<p>You will be responsible for conducting user research (field research and usability tests), modeling user behaviors (scenarios and personas), and developing wireframes and prototypes, all within a very Lean UX environment.&nbsp; These guys are building something that has never existed before, and you will be a key player in helping to translate a very complex human interaction into an engaging and very human digital interaction.</p>

Club features interviews and reviews of various newly released media, and other weekly features. The print edition also contains restaurant reviews and previews of upcoming live entertainment specific to cities where a print edition is published. The online incarnation of The A.V.

Nobody does high-tech computing porn like Apple -- even the air inside the store seemed to display at a higher resolution than I am normally accustomed to.

No, not poll numbers, or internal disputes, or the candidate himself, though those are all problems too.

Unfortunately for Romney, the details we have learned so far from the return only serve to reinforce the negative fallout from the "secret video."</p><p>We'll be poring over the actual returns soon, but an initial release from the Romney campaign <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/blogs/mitts-view/2012/09/note-trustee-brad-malt"> has already told us a couple of amusing things.</a></p><p>First, Mitt and Ann Romney donated a whole heck of a lot of money to charity in 2011 -- $4,020,772, to be exact, or about 30 percent of their total income. But they chose only to claim $2.25 million of that total as charitable deductions, because, well, otherwise their overall tax burden would have been a little, shall we say, <em>light.</em></p><p>From the campaign:</p><blockquote><p>The Romneys&rsquo; generous charitable donations in 2011 would have significantly reduced their tax obligation for the year. The Romneys thus limited their deduction of charitable contributions to conform to the Governor's statement in August, based upon the January estimate of income, that he paid at least 13% in income taxes in each of the last 10 years.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/09/21/romneys_tax_return_comedy/">Continue Reading...</a></p></div><div class='chunk'>Salon.com<a href='http://www.salon.com/2012/09/21/obama_denounces_anti_islam_film_on_pakistani_tv/>Obama denounces anti-Islam film on Pakistani TV</a><p>In an effort to calm frayed nerves after a week of protests, the US aired advertisements on Pakistani television denouncing the amateur anti-Islam film "The Innocence of Muslims."</p><p><a href="http://www.globalpost.com/"><img src="http://images.salon.com/img/partners/ID_globalPostInline.gif" alt="Global Post" align="left"></a></p><p>The film trailer has caused waves of protests at US embassies around the Muslim world, including all over Pakistan, and has cost the life of the American ambassador to Libya, J.

<p><strong>Pitch:</strong> "Apoc stands for apocalypse. When the world ends, fancy lamps will be of little use and more primal needs like warmth and food will take precedence. This desk lamp can be deconstructed and turned into a small kindling fire at a moments notice. Just large enough to cook a rat."</p>

<p>Grant had a vision for this neglected house. Even though the realtor showed the house with fugly curtains, one sofa and a copier in the living room, and a run down yard, Grant and Mark were sold and immediately got to work.

<p>If you love your handsome little yard or patio and have been thinking about raising chickens, never fear. You're not reduced to choosing an eyesore for a chicken coop. With the growing popularity of chicken raising, coops that look like little more than mini shacks are falling by the wayside. <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/chickens-need-style-too-5-great-coops-177379">More</a></p><br><a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/chickens-need-style-too-5-great-coops-177379">Read More...</a>

<p>Updating old laminate countertops without having to completely replace them can be a big challenge. Faux finishes can often look, well&hellip; <em>faux</em>, and tackling a DIY project (like pouring your own concrete countertops) can be tricky and exhausting. That's why I was so impressed with this project from interior designer Kara Paslay.</p>

<div class='chunk'>Health : The Atlantic<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~3/SxhvLAXGNlU/story01.htm>We're More Open-Minded Than We Think</a><p><i>Researchers show how easily we switch to arguing against our stated moral positions.</i></p>  <p>What's your stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Are you sure? In a <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0045457?imageURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0045457.t001">study</a> published in PLoS ONE, Swedish researchers got 160 survey respondents to report their positions on a variety of morally sticky concepts -- and then got the majority of them to change their minds without even realizing it.</p> <p>The video shows how they pulled off the trick, the gist of it being that the original statements that the participants rated their agreement or disagreement with were surreptitiously reversed. So when participants returned to their responses, it now appeared that they were agreeing or disagreeing with the direct opposite of what they had originally seen.&nbsp; And <i>voila --</i> those who found Israeli violence against Hamas morally reprehensible were suddenly supporting it.<br></p><p>These switches went unnoticed 69 percent of the time. This video doesn't show subjects arguing vehemently in favor of moral issues that they had just claimed to oppose, but 53 percent ending up doing just that, including the most polarized of respondents.</p> <p>The positive takeaway is that people are more open-minded than we generally give them credit for. The more pessimistic way of looking at it is that we aren't all that principled, and the conceptions of morality upon which society is built are actually a huge sham. If nothing else, it definitely calls to question the utility of surveys being able to tell us anything about what people actually think.</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625830/s/23ae9a41/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=We%27re+More+Open-Minded+Than+We+Think&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fwere-more-open-minded-than-we-think%2F262681%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=We%27re+More+Open-Minded+Than+We+Think&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fwere-more-open-minded-than-we-think%2F262681%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540661015/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ae9a41/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540661015/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ae9a41/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144540661015/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ae9a41/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~4/SxhvLAXGNlU" height="1" width="1"></div><div class='chunk'>Health : The Atlantic<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~3/qLnyM6AE3UU/story01.htm>Decorating for the Afterlife: The Modern American Mausoleum</a><p><i>"The peculiar mix of modernism and death reflects the things most kitsch, troubling, and beautiful about our modern culture."</i></p> <div><div align="center"><a href="http://flavorwire.com/"><img alt="flavorpillheader.PNG" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/culture_test/flavorpillheader.PNG" width="227" height="52"></a></div> <p> <span><a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/330128/10-of-the-creepiest-ghosts-in-literature"><b>The Creepiest Ghosts in Literature</b></a></span><br><span><a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/329019/abandoned-spaces-reclaimed-by-art"><b>Abandoned Spaces Reclaimed by Art</b></a></span><br><span><a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/326340/tv-sitcoms-most-boundary-breaking-families"><b>TV Sitcoms' Most Boundary-Breaking Families</b></a></span><br></p><hr></div> <p> In the 1950s, a fashion for interring the deceased in luxurious marble mausoleums (as opposed to burial plots) took hold -- as far as fashions for the dead can take hold, we mean. After taking a tour of one such facility, Chicago-based photographer <a href="http://www.johnfaier.com/">John Faier</a>&nbsp;was hooked, and spent six years photographing mausoleums from the time period all over the country. We spotted his resultant photo series,<em> <a href="http://www.johnfaier.com/personal_work.htm" target="_blank">Queen of Heaven</a></em>, over at <a href="http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2012/09/mausoleums-john-faier/" target="_blank">Raw File</a>. The mausoleums have an ominous, almost surreal feeling, like the chapel in the Overlook Hotel as photographed by David Lynch, both lavish and somehow hollow-feeling. "Bright colors, matching upholstery, matching lamp shades -- the architecture reminds us more of a cocktail lounger or hotel, not of a mausoleum," Faier muses. "The peculiar mix of modernism and death reflects the things most kitsch, troubling, and beautiful about our modern culture." Even more peculiar? Over six years of shooting, he says, he never ran into a mourner. </p><p></p> <img alt="ma11.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma11.jpg" width="600" height="450"><img alt="ma6.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma6.jpg" width="600" height="480"><img alt="ma8.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma8.jpg" width="600" height="480"><img alt="ma5.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma5.jpg" width="600" height="600"><img alt="ma9.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma9.jpg" width="600" height="600"><img alt="ma7.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma7.jpg" width="600" height="480"><img alt="ma.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma.jpg" width="600" height="600"><img alt="ma2.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma2.jpg" width="600" height="480"><img alt="ma3.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma3.jpg" width="600" height="600"><img alt="ma4.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/ma4.jpg" width="600" height="600"><div><em><small>Photos courtesy of <a href="http://www.johnfaier.com/">John Faier</a></small> </em></div><div><em><small><br></small></em></div><hr><em>This post also appears on <a href="http://www.flavorwire.com/330230/the-eerie-beauty-of-american-mausoleums?all=1">Flavorpill</a>, an </em>Atlantic<em> partner site. </em><p></p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625830/s/23ada88f/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Decorating+for+the+Afterlife%3A+The+Modern+American+Mausoleum&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fdecorating-for-the-afterlife-the-modern-american-mausoleum%2F262669%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Decorating+for+the+Afterlife%3A+The+Modern+American+Mausoleum&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fdecorating-for-the-afterlife-the-modern-american-mausoleum%2F262669%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145605771873/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ada88f/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145605771873/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ada88f/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145605771873/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ada88f/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~4/qLnyM6AE3UU" height="1" width="1"></div><div class='chunk'>Health : The Atlantic<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~3/G4D_9avq4As/story01.htm>The Therapeutic Experience of Being Suspended by Your Skin</a><p><i>The 5,000 year history of the "art" comes down to physics, spirituality, and risk.</i></p> <p><img alt="bodysuspensionmain3ap.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/bodysuspensionmain3ap45.jpg" width="615" height="300"></p><div>A man suspended in Lviv, Ukraine [Pavlo Palamarchuk/AP]</div> <p></p> <p> A woman lies face down on a massage table. She is tended to by five men wearing surgical masks and gloves. The men aren't wearing scrubs, though, and elaborate tattoos are visible on three of the men's arms. They insert large fishhooks under the woman's skin: in her calves, thighs, and lower, middle, and upper back. They work quickly and with practiced efficiency, grabbing a good sized piece of skin, pushing the hook into the skin until -- pop -- it slides in and out the other side. There is no blood. The men position the hook's bend around the freshly pierced hunk of flesh before moving onto another piercing. </p> <p> The woman goes by the name Trigger. She posted a video montage of several of her body suspensions -- a form of body modification that involves hanging a human body by hooks attached to ropes -- to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvQ57R0IoI4">YouTube</a>. In her video description, in an attempt to ward off hurtful comments from both the prejudiced and the Internet's resident ignoramuses, she wrote: </p> <blockquote> <p> This is a little music video I made to footage of some of my suspensions. Some were hard and painful, some were fun &amp; painful. Either way, I'm always grateful for the opportunities I had to do these suspensions and will never forget what an impact they have had and continue having on my life. </p> <p> Enjoy this video, but please, no comments about how gross this is... if you don't understand it or agree with it, that's perfectly okay, but there is no need for disrespectful comments. </p> </blockquote> <p> The rest of the video, after the piercings, shows Trigger suspended. She hangs in a number of positions: from hooks inserted into her upper back, known as a suicide suspension because the suspended person appears to have hanged him or herself; from the skin around her knees; and face down from hooks that run the length of her back and legs in what is called a Superman suspension. A suspension artist, who is responsible for setting up the hooks, ropes, and pulleys for the suspension, monitors the entire process. During some of Trigger's suspensions, a man hugs her tenderly and strokes her hair, rocking her body gently back and forth in the air. For the Superman suspension, she remains in a resting position. During one of her two suicide suspensions, she swings back and forth in a wide arc. </p> <p> "Really beautiful, thanks for sharing," one commenter wrote. </p> <blockquote>Tearing of the skin can, and does, happen, but it's almost never the sort of dramatic freefall that someone watching a suspension for the first time might imagine.</blockquote> <p> "Hey, just wanted to let you know that I am finally going up!" wrote another. "Thank you for giving me the inspiration to do this. I have a 4 pt knee scheduled for tomorrow!" </p> <p> One simply asked, "Why?" </p><p>***</p> <p> People have been hanging themselves from hooks for roughly 5,000 years. Perhaps the most ancient suspensions occurred in India, where suspension was a sort of religious penance. Devotees at the ancient Hindu festival Thaipusam, which continues to this day throughout Southeast Asia and is popular among Tamils, suspend themselves in a practice called <em>vel kavadi</em>. Those who perform the <em>vel kavadi </em>pierce their flesh with hooks and skewers -- stand-ins for the spear that Shiva's wife, Parvati, gave to the god of war Murugan to kill the demon Soorapadam -- as an expression of debt bondage and devotion to Murugan. The pierced worshippers often attach ropes to their hooks, which are pulled by other devotees or used to suspend the worshippers in the air. The level of pain the suspended feels correlates with the level of devotion--the more pain, the more sincere the worship. Suspensions also occur at the Chidi Mari festival, another Tamil holiday. </p> <p> Half a world away, on the banks of the Missouri River, the Mandan tribe suspended young warriors in an annual rite of passage ceremony that celebrated the creation of the earth. The Okipa ceremony, as it was called, required initiates to fast and hold vigil for four days, then dance, and lastly perform trials of endurance. The warriors-to-be had to prove their strength to their elders and the spirits. The young men were suspended from the roof of the tribe's lodge by ropes attached to skewers in their chest, back or shoulders. To increase the pain, weights were attached to their legs. Cries of agony were considered cowardly. The warriors would faint and were brought down to be watched over by the men who presided over the ceremony. When an initiate woke up, it signified the spirits' approval.&nbsp;</p><p>The new initiates then had their left pinky removed with a hatchet, and finished the ceremony by racing around the village in a race called "the last race." The skewers were still in place, the weights still attached. The Okipa ceremony was first documented by an outsider around 1835 when George Catlin, an American painter on an expedition with William Clark, produced a painting of the ceremony. The last Okipa ceremony took place in 1889. A variation of the Okipa ceremony was made famous in the 1973 film <em>A Man Called Horse </em>when Richard Harris' character underwent a similar ceremony in order to gain acceptance from the Lakota tribe that had taken him prisoner. </p> <p> Though many people who practice suspension see it as a spiritual experience and a way to test themselves, most suspensions today are not performed as religious sacraments or trials of endurance. For some, it's a sort of, "If I can do this, I can do anything," attitude. For others, it is akin to meditation.&nbsp;</p><p>Modern suspension has been largely shaped by Fakir Musafar, a man who was born on an Indian reservation in South Dakota with the name Roland Loomis and developed, or brought back, many types of suspension. Musafar performed the Okipa suspension in 1966 and also coined the term "modern primitives" to describe a subculture that practices body modification with a particular interest in rite of passage rituals. For Musafar, and many others after him, body modification is a form of self-expression and spiritual exploration, a way to move beyond the body into a higher spiritual plane. But others who practice suspension today distance themselves from the sort of ritualistic elements espoused by Musafar, and instead choose to hang for the sake of hanging. </p><p>***</p><p><br></p> <p> </p><blockquote>"And this was just the ultimate stress release. Everything bad that had built up, it was just resetting it back to zero."</blockquote> <p></p> <p>Cere Coichetti is the head of the New York chapter of Rites of Passage, a group that facilitates suspensions up and down the east coast. He first was introduced to suspension twelve years ago through his friend Brian, a body modification artist in New York. Brian had a friend, Emrys, who had recently moved to New York from Boston and who practiced suspension, something that Coichetti, though active in the body modification scene, hadn't heard of. Suspension requires a small team of helpers to set up and monitor the suspension, and Emrys enlisted Coichetti and Brian to help him suspend. Within a week or so, Coichetti tried his first suspension -- a Superman. </p> <div> <img alt="SHARK300200.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/suspension200300bw.jpg" width="200" height="300">A Superman at a suspension conference in Tel Aviv. [AmirCohen/Reuters]</div> <p> "I wanted to see if I was tough enough to do it," Coichetti said with a smile as we talked over meatball sliders at a restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. "It came down to a challenge to myself, a test of strength. If I can put hooks in my body -- suspend my near 300-pound frame from little hooks -- then there's nothing I couldn't do. I thought it was going to hurt. I thought it was going to suck. I thought it was going to be the most traumatizing experience of my life." </p> <p> Coichetti's body is covered in tattoos, and his head, shaved bald, is adorned with a neatly trimmed goatee. In his ears, for aesthetic reasons, he has removed the cartilage around the ear canal in what is known as a conch removal. It's possible to see through the little holes in his ears, but you wouldn't even notice the modification unless you sat down and talked with him. He is lively and expressive, and as he told me about his first suspension, he did a good deal of speaking with his hands. </p> <p> "So, I go in and I'm ready to go through it," he said, "and once I got into the air, once they lifted me up, it was the most peaceful, serene, blissful experience I've ever had. And it was kind of like, throughout life, you tend to take on negative energy -- by energy I could mean stress -- stress from your job, stress from home, if you're married, if you've got kids -- just stress. And this was just the ultimate stress release. Everything bad that had built up, it was just resetting it back to zero."</p> <p> "The second I came down, I knew I wanted to go back up." </p> <p> Shortly after his first suspension, Coichetti began to study the rigging aspects of suspension. He consulted Allen Falkner, one of Fakir Musafar's apprentices and also one of the greatest influences on suspension as a non-ritualistic act, to learn about suspension techniques. </p> <p> Coichetti says that he has helped people from all walks of life suspend, including lawyers, wrestlers, doctors, acrobats and politicians. Two of Trigger's suspensions in her YouTube video were done by Rites of Passage. The group performs suspensions free of charge, but ask for a suggested donation to cover the cost of hooks and other equipment. Any money Rites of Passage receives in excess of the suggested donation goes to sending the group's members to certification courses in first aid and industrial rigging. </p> <p> "Suspension can be broken into two aspects," Coichetti said, "basically the medical aspect and the rigging aspect. By medical, I mean the insertion of the hooks, the cleaning, the blood, the skin, how that all works. The hard part about suspension has nothing to do with the body. It's everything above the hooks." </p> <p> The rigging methods of suspension are borrowed from techniques developed for construction, rock climbing, and stage rigging (think Cirque de Soleil). Those who master the rigging techniques are referred to as suspension artists. </p> <p> "The term <i>suspension artist </i>is a bit misleading," Coichetti said. Suspension is, he insisted, a skill. "It's not really an art. Anyone can learn to be a suspension artist. It's science. It's math. It's understanding principles and practicing and putting those principles into effect. </p> <p> "When we go up to install rigging points, we need to know what the ceiling is made of, how it's constructed, what it can support. I need to know what it's already supporting on top of it. If I'm stressing a ceiling at a fracture point where they have an air compression unit on top of it, I need to know that." </p> <p> The rest, Coichetti said, is all physics, and it boils down to F=MA. </p> <p> "When I have a pulley system on a ceiling, if you weigh 100 pounds, I have to exert 100 pounds to lift you off the ground," he said. "Now, you also have motion. You have to figure out the angle of motion, the rate of acceleration. I do it in my head. I have to figure out how much stress you are putting on the top rig, on the pulley, on the rope, on your hooks, on yourself, and I have to make sure everything is within a correct range." </p> <p> To more easily hoist the weight of a human body, suspension artists make use of mechanical advantage, rigging up complex pulley systems that facilitate the raising and lowering of the suspended person. Coichetti once rigged a woman in a marionette suspension, where hooks were inserted on the woman's back, into her legs, and into her arms, so that the woman was suspended as a living, breathing marionette controlled by Coichetti with the movement of his hand and arm. </p> <p> "I had to figure out a way to attach all her points to a glove," Coichetti said. "So that going like this," he moved two fingers up and down as if playing a piano, "would raise her left arm, would raise her right arm. And I had to rig it all so that just three inches of motion would create four feet of motion on her side." Moving his arm up and down lowered and raised the woman. </p> <p> He acknowledged, though, that he had a little help with lifting the woman's limbs with his fingers--most people, he said, when they feel a hook pulling on their arm tend to raise their arm along with the upward pull. </p><p>***</p> <p> The most visibly jarring thing about watching a suspension is seeing flesh stretch as it supports the weight of the body. It looks like it's about to rip -- sending the suspended person falling to the ground amidst a confetti of torn flesh and blood -- but it's actually quite safe. During a suspension, hooks are inserted under the dermis and into the subcutaneous fatty tissue, a very resilient chunk of flesh. </p> <p> "Skin is pretty strong," Dr. Nelson Goldberg, a plastic surgeon at the University of Maryland Medical Center, said. "It's basically leather, and in the back it's basically double leather. I think it could easily handle the tension before it would rip." </p> <p> Dr. Brett King, an assistant professor of dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine, sees suspension as an application of physics and a testament to the human body's remarkable toughness and healing ability. </p> <div> <img alt="SHARK300200.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/RTR2OPDY300200susp.jpg" width="300" height="200">[AmirCohen/Reuters]</div> <p> "You're putting your body's weight worth of force across that tissue," King said, "and it's quite striking that the skin holds up as well as it does. My guess is that, whether or not the practitioners of suspension realize it or not, the people who plant the hooks in the skin understand that there's a tremendous amount of physics to all of this. They must use hooks that are appropriately thick to hook an appropriately broad swath of skin. You can imagine, if you were to take something as thin as a slim nail and kind of loop it under the skin and back out, and then pull the two ends away from the body, it might very well rip the skin. Alternatively, if a much wider nail or hook is sewn underneath and back out across a wide enough section of skin, then suddenly there is enough fabric to support the weight. It's a calculation that involves the total dimension of skin across which you're supporting some amount of weight." </p> <p> "It's kind of dazzling," he said, "to conceive the entire body's weight being supported by a couple of hooks through the chest." </p> <p> "It's pretty cool," he added. </p> <p> When I asked Coichetti to describe the sensation of being suspended, he said, "It's this odd pressure, and it almost feels like--" he paused, thinking. "Do you ever stand in the sunlight, like at the beach, and, not that it hurts, but you can feel when you're burning? Like, 'Aw, man, I can feel the heat. I can feel myself burning. I know I've gotta get out of the sunlight.' That burning sensation. You feel that. It's not painful, but you definitely feel burning. And you feel this odd pressure happening. Once you're in the air for, like, 30 or 40 seconds, that burn fades away. And then you get hit with the euphoria. You still feel the pressure, but at that point in time, you're elsewhere." </p> <p> "Grab the meat of our best friend's back and just yank up really hard," AJ Karras suggested. "Try to pick them up, too." </p> <p> Karras, a young woman with pink hair, came to New York City from outside Amherst, Massachusetts, to be suspended for the first time by Coichetti. She was excited, and her boyfriend had come with her for his first suspension, too. Karras has been involved in the body modification scene for about five years, and has been helping out with suspensions and heavier body modifications, mostly types of cosmetic implants, for the last two. </p> <p> "I saw suspension videos when I was 15 years old," she said, "and I was like, 'Dude, I have to try that. I just have to.' I just always knew that it was part of me." </p> <p> I asked her what types of suspension she was interested in trying. </p> <p> "All of them," she said without hesitation. "Eventually. Gotta let my body heal up between, but eventually I want to try as many different and new things as we can think of." </p> <p> Tearing of the skin can, and does, happen, but it's almost never the sort of dramatic freefall that someone watching a suspension for the first time might imagine. There are certain parts of the body, like the knees and the chest, where tearing is more likely to occur. Tearing happens slowly, and there is more than enough time, Coichetti said, to get the suspended person down on the ground before there is any serious injury. Skilled suspension artists can tell when the skin is beginning to tear, and will inform the suspended person what is going on. </p> <blockquote>Coichetti's biggest concern about suspension is that people will try to imitate what they see on the Internet without the proper medical and technical knowledge required to perform a safe suspension.</blockquote> <p> "When someone is in the air and they're swinging around," Coichetti said, "and I see that tearing has begun, I'll stop them and be like, 'Your skin is beginning to tear. It's not an issue right now, but in about a minute or two it's going to get to the point where you need a stitch or two. Are you comfortable with that?' If someone's in danger of the skin completely opening, we bring them down. They don't have a choice. But if you're suspending and you're at this moment, most people go, 'Leave me up here, suture me later.'" </p> <p> You can find examples of suspensions gone wrong on the Internet. At a certain point, skin gives out, as King said. In most cases when a suspended person falls, though, the fall isn't due to the skin actually ripping. Improper insertion of the hooks, in conjunction with a high degree of motion, can result in the hooks sliding out. Professionals who are attempting suspensions at great heights or suspensions that involve a good deal of motion will rig up a safety harness that acts as a failsafe should the hooks come out for some reason.&nbsp;</p><p>One video on Hook Life, a blog that caters to the suspension community, shows a Russian suspension team suspending a man in an abandoned warehouse. The man freefalls from a great height, then swings back and forth. He is harnessed in. Hook Life, though, added a lengthy disclaimer before posting the video, warning readers, essentially, not to try this at home. Coichetti's biggest concern about suspension is that people will try to imitate what they see on the Internet without the proper medical and technical knowledge required to perform a safe suspension. </p> <p> Both King and Goldberg considered infection to be the greatest risk during suspension, but knowledgeable suspension artists use sterilized hooks, needles, and gauze when suspending someone to minimize the risk. Some scarring is inevitable, but when Coichetti showed me a point on his leg where he had suspended seven times, I wouldn't have noticed anything if it weren't for a white spot in a tattoo, evidence of where hooks had been. There is, as King suggested, a high level of physics and medical knowledge being put to use during a suspension, and Coichetti says safety is his number one priority. He is a certified first responder, meaning he is trained in providing pre-hospital care for medical emergencies, and a volunteer fire fighter. Most of his team are certified in first aid care, and two of the suspension artists in the Rites of Passage Boston chapter are paramedics. If someone has a medical condition that would complicate a suspension, he consults the person's doctor to clear him or her for suspension. He has turned some people looking to suspend away due to the medical risks that a condition presents. </p> <p> "It's up to the individual to figure out if the harm involved -- which, realistically is very minimal -- is worth what they get out of it," Coichetti said. "And the answer for suspenders is yes. Shock can be life threatening, but, I mean, you break your leg, you go into shock. Shock is on a spectrum," he made a wide space with his two hands, "we're just fucking around in this range," he said, using two fingers to indicate the very low end. And, he says, if something ever were to go wrong, the first thing he would do would be to call an ambulance. </p> <p> That feeling of shock is what many who suspend are looking for -- the rush of endorphins, serotonin, and other chemicals that results in a sort of high. Some see it as a spiritual experience. Others find it exhilarating, and laugh while they are suspended. A subset of those who practice suspension do it as a type of performance art, choreographing lurid and shocking spectacles that are performed in front of audiences. </p> <p> "A performance is there to shock the hell out of you," Coichetti said. "They're going to scream, they're going to make it look like it's the most bloody, painful, awful thing in the world. And it's all an act to get a visceral reaction out of the audience." </p> <p> Performance suspensions, Coichetti said, with their focus on shock value, can cheapen the type of suspension that he practices, which focuses more on creating a unique experience tailored to the suspended person. </p> <p> "I feel like it puts out the wrong public perception about what we do," he said. </p> <p> <strong></strong> </p> <p> "Spirituality is very important to me," Coichetti said. But, he clarified, "I'm very technical. I look at, when I'm doing a suspension or any kind of ritual, what physically is going on. I want to know what's causing this euphoria. We're in a world nowadays where I don't have to go, 'Oh, the state of euphoria is caused by this god raining down on me.' This state of euphoria is caused by <em>these</em> certain chemicals being released because of <em>these</em> physical triggers. I will absolutely suspend you and have a drum circle going on, beating on drums and chanting; not because I'm a hippy, but because I know steady bass rhythms allow your brain to function at a theta level and it allows you to trance easier."</p> <p> "Now, even though I'm very technical and I want to get into the chemistry of this, it's still a spiritual experience. Is it spiritual to a god? To the world? To myself? I don't know, I'll figure that out one day," he said with a smile. "All I know is that my end result, regardless of how I get there, is a feeling of complete freedom." </p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625830/s/23acd65f/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=The+Therapeutic+Experience+of+Being+Suspended+by+Your+Skin&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fthe-therapeutic-experience-of-being-suspended-by-your-skin%2F262644%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=The+Therapeutic+Experience+of+Being+Suspended+by+Your+Skin&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fthe-therapeutic-experience-of-being-suspended-by-your-skin%2F262644%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608326434/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23acd65f/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608326434/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23acd65f/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608326434/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23acd65f/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~4/G4D_9avq4As" height="1" width="1"></div><div class='chunk'>Health : The Atlantic<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~3/VSteUjkBwoU/story01.htm>Study: Oxytocin ('The Hormone of Love') Also Makes Us Conformists</a><p> <em>You think your tastes are your own, but it may actually be that a hormone is making members of a groups share the same preferences.</em> </p> <img alt="sheepmain.jpg" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/sheepmain.jpg" height="230" width="615"><span>Rambling Traveler/Flickr</span> <p> <strong>PROBLEM: </strong> Oxytocin, which you may also know as "the hormone of love," is the <a href="http://io9.com/5925206/10-reasons-why-oxytocin-is-the-most-amazing-molecule-in-the-world">driving force</a> behind sociability, trust, and generosity. It enables everything from mother-child bonding to orgasms, and it's one of the main things that sociopaths lack. The catch is that it strictly promotes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/science/11hormone.html">in-group love</a> -- and so it can't be used to kumbaya away cultural and political conflicts.

But for the sake of standardization (and because you can't fake a hug), researchers administered the hormone via nasal spray to 34 subjects and a placebo to 35 others. The men participated in unrelated busywork until the oxytocin kicked in, at which point they were asked to rate symbols on an attractiveness scale of 1 to 11. ("<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbVKWCpNFhY">These go to eleven.</a>")&nbsp;</p><p>As they did so, they were shown everyone else's responses, including those of the other members of their randomly-determined "group." To ensure that people weren't trying to win social favor by agreeing with others in their group, the participants were not aware of one another's identities. </p> <p> <strong>RESULTS: </strong> Barring the chance that some of the symbols were inherently more attractive than others, the subjects demonstrated a general tendency to conform to other people's opinions: oxytocin or not, they gave significantly higher ratings to symbols that other participants also liked, and vice-versa. But in cases where one's group liked a symbol and "outsiders" didn't, the subjects doped with oxytocin trended toward their group members' ratings. This held regardless of how many favorable or disfavorable opinions they saw before passing their own judgment and was not observed in the placebo group. </p> <p> <strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Oxytocin stimulates in-group conformity -- to the extent that subjective preference is influenced by horde mentality. <br></p> <p> <strong>IMPLICATIONS: </strong> Oxytocin's effects were context-dependent, only causing conformity when the in-group's opinion was opposed to the out-group's. It may be that the hormone promotes in-group identification through shared biases, suggest the authors, ultimately functioning in the same way that team uniforms or gang colors do "to signal group membership and establish intergroup differentiation." </p> <p> <em> The full study, "<a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/09/18/0956797612446026.abstract?rss=1">The Herding Hormone; Oxytocin Stimulates In-Group Conformity</a>," </em> <em>will be published in the journal </em><a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/"> Psychological Science</a>.<em> </em> </p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625830/s/23ab511d/mf.gif" border="0"><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Study%3A+Oxytocin+%28%27The+Hormone+of+Love%27%29+Also+Makes+Us+Conformists&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fstudy-oxytocin-the-hormone-of-love-also-makes-us-conformists%2F262637%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Study%3A+Oxytocin+%28%27The+Hormone+of+Love%27%29+Also+Makes+Us+Conformists&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2012%2F09%2Fstudy-oxytocin-the-hormone-of-love-also-makes-us-conformists%2F262637%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608321447/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ab511d/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608321447/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ab511d/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608321447/u/49/f/625830/c/34375/s/23ab511d/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticFood/~4/VSteUjkBwoU" height="1" width="1"></div>

</p><p></p><div><a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/image.jpg"><img src="http://www.webmonkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/image-300x119.jpg" alt="" title="image" width="300" height="119"></a><p><em>Image: Screenshot/Webmonkey</em></p></div>Apple&rsquo;s recent iOS 6 update added some nice new web standards support to Mobile Safari, the default iOS web browser for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. 
<p>Apple&rsquo;s documentation remains sparse and occasionally outdated, but luckily Max Firtman, author of O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s <em>Programming the Mobile Web</em>, has a very thorough rundown of <a href="http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/iphone-5-ios-6-html5-developers">everything that&rsquo;s new in iOS for web developers</a>.</p>
<p>By far the biggest news is support for file uploads and camera access using a combination of the File API and the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/camera/">HTML Media Capture API</a>. To let users take a picture from your web app, you&rsquo;d use a file input tag something like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="camera"&gt;
</pre>
<p>Mobile Safari&rsquo;s Media Capture support is incomplete so it will ignore the <code>capture</code> attribute, as well as any value for <code>accept</code> other than <code>image</code> or <code>video</code>, but at least web apps can now capture and upload images from the iPhone&rsquo;s camera. </p>
<p>I put together a quick <a href="http://longhandpixels.net/demos/mobilesafari-ios6/">demo page of Mobile Safari&rsquo;s Media Capture support</a> so you can see the new interface in action. The first two examples on that page work, the third <code>audio</code> example does not. You can see in the demo that Mobile Safari helpfully shows a thumbnail of the image prior to upload. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Mobile Safari supports the <code>multiple</code> boolean flag for uploading more than one image at a time, though in that case you lose the ability to access the camera. </p>
<p>For more on what to do with those images once the user has selected them, check out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications">Mozilla developer network</a>, which has an excellent tutorial on using the File API.</p>
<p>Other highlights for web developers in the new Mobile Safari include support for the Web Audio API (great news for anyone building mobile, web-based games), increased application cache sizes (now 25MB), a faster JavaScript engine and some new CSS tricks as well &mdash; CSS Filters, CSS Cross Fades and the <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2012/08/safari-chrome-now-support-high-resolution-images-in-css/">not-yet-a-standard CSS Image Set</a> we told you about earlier. Be sure to read through <a href="http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/iphone-5-ios-6-html5-developers">Firtman&rsquo;s whole post</a> for all the details.</p>
<p>While there&rsquo;s plenty to like about the new Mobile Safari there are some things missing, like support for WebRTC and getUserMedia, WebGL and sadly our least favorite bug &mdash; the <a href="http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/iphone-safari-viewport-scaling-bug">Viewport Scaling Bug</a>, which causes Mobile Safari to incorrectly reflow content when rotating from portrait to landscape &mdash; seems to still be hanging around. As always there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://gist.github.com/901295">JavaScript workaround available</a>.</p></div>

<p>While perusing Weekend Carnival, we came across a post that featured the blog owner&rsquo;s new <a href="http://weekdaycarnival.blogspot.com/2012/09/new-carpet-from-fleamarket.html" target="_blank">flea market rug find</a>, paired with some simple Scandinavian furniture and crisp white elements. The color palette is punchy and powerful, and the rug&rsquo;s subtle pattern goes well with the complicated wicker pattern of the chair.</p>

<p>While shooting the home of Lindsay Nakashima (grand niece of George Nakashima) for an upcoming <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/" target="_blank">Apartment Therapy</a> house tour, we noticed a fun texture combo there, too: an Oriental rug, mixing with wood floors, mixing with a faux fur throw, over a herringbone-patterned blanket with the blue felt of that bed.</p>

<p>Been wanting to add some drama and darkness into your home but didn&rsquo;t know how? It&rsquo;s not crazy modern but&nbsp;the <a href="http://lasociete.ca/index.html" target="_blank">La Societe Bistro</a> in Toronto, Canada has a certain je ne sais quoi, with lots of elements just begging to be borrowed (or outright stolen) for a kitchen, living room or heck even bedroom in a modern home. &ldquo;A marriage of Canada&rsquo;s most cosmopolitan city and Parisian bistro style and cuisine, La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; is a dining destination unlike any other in Toronto. Gloriously appointed with luxurious furnishings and a breathtaking stained-glass ceiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steal the dark color palette of this space. Or perhaps those great light fixtures. Or even the slightly Art Nouveau elements. If you dig the metalwork of this space, you should thank&nbsp;<a href="http://bastillemetalworks.com/" target="_blank">Bastille Metal Works</a>, an architectural metal design company that specializes in custom metal furnishings for commercial and residential locations. &nbsp;The process they use is &nbsp;&ldquo;slip-casting,&rdquo; a technique that fuses metals.

A scanning laser then reads the distance of the object as it rotates and translates that data into musical notes.
<p>Created by <a href="http://www.d3-is.de/">Dennis P Paul</a>, this instrument creates loops that are remarkably reminiscent of Dubstep. The user can slide the laser back and forth, picking up different parts of the object, and a stepper motor that rotates the spindle can be synched to an existing drumbeat. The data from the laser is sent to <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> before being exported melodically.</p>

<p></p><div><div></div></div><a href="http://makeprojects.com/Project/Little-Big-Lamp/2310/1">Little Big Lamp</a> was originally conceived and built in 2006 by MAKE Contributing Editor <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2009/12/19/make-electronics-interview-with-c/">Charles Platt</a> as a low-power alternative to incandescent bulbs, and wired to run on 12V for use in motor homes. Six years ago, when white LEDs were in their relative infancy, Charles&rsquo; project required 72 10mm LEDs, consuming 5W of power to produce the comparable amount of light as a 60W incandescent. These days, even greater brightness and spread of beam is possible, and the circuit has been updated to use 18 5mm LEDs.
<p>This project is composed of three segments: the LED array, the simple circuit, and the lamp body. This is a good project to learn about wiring LEDs in series without resistors. The simple circuit, which combines the venerable <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/tag/555-timer/">555 Timer</a> with a Darlington array, will introduce you to the principle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_width_modulation" target="_blank">Pulse Width Modulation</a>. As for the lamp body, that&rsquo;s where your maker chops come in! Charles used PVC components purchased from plumbing and hardware stores to build his minimalist desk lamp. You are free to follow this design, or customize your own to suit your space and needs. Some modifications that come to mind include a gooseneck, using clear plexi so all the wiring and components are visible, or rewiring the circuit to be battery powered for true portability. The possibilities are endless!</p>

<p>The EnableTalk system uses a glove-mounted microcontroller to collate information from a passel of onboard sensors&mdash;11 flex sensors, 8 touch sensors, 2 accelerometers, a compass, and a gyroscope&mdash;and transmit it wirelessly to a nearby computer or smartphone for translation into machine generated speech. The Ukrainian development team&mdash;Posternikov Anton,&nbsp;Maxim Osika,&nbsp;Anton Stepanov, and&nbsp;Valera Yasakov&mdash;recently won the <a href="http://www.imaginecup.com/IC12/Champions/SoftwareDesign">2012 Microsoft Imagine Cup&rsquo;s</a> 1st place &ldquo;Software Design&rdquo; award, and took home $25K. Their prototype includes solar panels to help prolong battery life. [Thanks, Tim!]</p>

<p>And so The Weekender sent down some tablets onto which were scribed the Ten Commandments of Weekenderism. 1. Be nice. 2. Be creative. 3. Make coffee sometimes. 4. Do exercise. 5. Don&rsquo;t be a ruddy idiot. 6. Smile. 7. Sing. 8. Laugh until you snort. 9. Laugh at other people for snorting thus exacerbating their laughter.10. Read The Weekender <span>EVERY</span> Friday and tell your pals about it. And the people rejoiced and made a massive statue out of fudge in celebration. here ends the lesson. Boom!</p>

<p>When things get political in the art world sometimes it can get uncomfortable &ndash; the work is so drenched in hidden messages that it&rsquo;s like playing hide and seek with a mountain. So it&rsquo;s a relief to gaze upon the work of Akram Zaatari who manages to pass comment but deal with it in such an intimate and close way, you feel much more informed about the world.</p>

You may remember back in April when we featured http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/vahram-muratyan Vahram Muratyan&rsquo;s stunning book of illustrations setting the city&rsquo;s sights, sounds and smells against each other, well now Tony Miotto has created this fantastic animated version of this trans-Atlantic head-to-head. If you see a finer abstract illustration of a hot-dog this week then you&rsquo;re probably wasting your life.</p>

<p>While you might well consider yourself inventive when it comes to food I bet you anything you have never considered turning cauliflower into a bobble hat or indeed broccoli into a handbag. But then again that is where you and artist Fulvio Bonavia probably differ.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever whiled away time (in a coffee shop or solicitor&rsquo;s office say) by trying to draw the perfect circle you&rsquo;ll know how ruddy frustrating it can be (damn you last minute bump!). But hang on, it turns out there&rsquo;s a theory that it&rsquo;s an impossible task to even create the perfect circle in this world as some outside influence will always distort it however minutely.</p>

<p>I once saw a lady drinking beer on the street in the sunshine with no shoes on, having a laugh to herself and the occasional sing-song. Crack addiction aside, that lady was pretty happy and free to do whatever she pleased on that sunny day and I&rsquo;m not afraid to admit I was jealous. This feeling swept over me once more when I was reintroduced to Brecht Vandenbroucke and his hilarious, gaudy pictures that I would give my right arm to be able to draw all day. Yes you big shot painter, you may be making thousands of pounds on portraits of the rich and famous, but have you seen what Brecht&rsquo;s doing? Oh, only drawing wolves&rsquo; heads in the sky, cars doing wheelies, fat people pushing gym equipment up escalators, and people crying with joy over naked ladies. Something about the quality and the content of Brecht&rsquo;s work reminds you that you can literally do whatever you want, as long as you do it well.</p>

<p>European Union border agreements might not be the most obvious starting point for a design showcase but when you think about it they have been integral to the new generation&rsquo;s creative education. With such free movement between European countries, designers have been able to absorb different cultures and approaches far more easily than their predecessors, boosted by exchange programmes like Erasmus.</p>

<div>The Atlantic Wire<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/_PspmPXu-S8/story01.htm>Sierra Blanca, Texas, Is Where Weed-Packed Tour Buses Go to Get Busted</a><p> Quick, aside from being busted for carrying weed, what's the one thing Fiona Apple, Willie Nelson, Snoop Dog, and Armie Hammer all have in common? Well, for starters, they can all tell you what a cell at Sierra Blanca's Hudspeth County Jail looks like.&nbsp;</p> <p> Apple, as news outlets reported, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0921/How-Fiona-Apple-was-caught-carrying-hashish-in-West-Texas-video">was released on bail </a>on Thursday in Sierra Blanca, Texas--a town, which if you're a Willie Nelson fan, or a Snoop Dogg aficionado, or a giant fan of&nbsp;<em>Mirror Mirror&nbsp;</em>should sound vaguely familiar since<a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/newupdated/ci_16717769"> Nelson in 2010</a>, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/01/28/celebrity-pot-busts-put-tiny-texas-county-on-map/">Snoop Dogg earlier this year</a>, and <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_19819504">Armie Hammer in November</a> were all busted for carrying marijuana in the same Texas town. In fact busting celebrities for weed has become such a regular occurrence that deputies in <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/01/28/celebrity-pot-busts-put-tiny-texas-county-on-map/">Sierra Blanca have even engaged in tomfoolery with the famous busts:</a></p> <blockquote> <p> Deputies posed for pictures with Snoop Dogg after authorities said they found several joints on his bus earlier this month. When Nelson was busted here in 2010, the county's lead prosecutor suggested the singer settle his marijuana charges by performing "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain" for the court. Nelson paid a fine instead, but not before county commissioner Wayne West played one of his own songs for the country music legend.</p> </blockquote> <p> <img alt="" src="http://cdn.theatlanticwire.com/img/upload/2012/09/21/rendered/90560af9f5b19756e4d78983059e98c4_623x326.jpg" data-original="http://cdn.theatlanticwire.com/img/upload/2012/09/21/Screen%20shot%202012-09-21%20at%203.22.54%20PM.png">So what is it about this Texas town that brings weed-toting celebrities from the music and film together? (From the looks of it on <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=sierra+blanca+texas&amp;ll=31.173553,-105.358061&amp;spn=0.00185,0.002497&amp;hnear=Sierra+Blanca,+Hudspeth,+Texas&amp;gl=us&amp;t=k&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=31.173514,-105.358148&amp;panoid=WIRJIlEt5ya3buN0zS78ZA&amp;cbp=12,35.04,,0,8.5">Google Maps</a>,&nbsp;it looks like a lonely place.) And perhaps more importantly why do they keep getting busted here.&nbsp;</p> <p> Well, there are three major reasons (unfortunately none of them include&nbsp;<a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/10/15/idINIndia-59904420111015">Steven Seagal who is a sworn-in border cop in these parts</a>):&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Location, Location, Location</b></p> <p> The thing about Sierra Blanca (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Blanca,_Texas">population 557)</a> is that it sits on a stretch of I-10--an interstate highway that stretches from California to Florida. "Film crews often travel through there to shoot. And musicians often bring their tours through the Southwest on that very highway," <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/347561/why-fiona-apple-armie-hammer-and-other-stars-are-gettin-busted-for-pot-in-same-texas-town">writes E!'s Leslie Gornstein</a>. And that--that it's both a route and a shooting destination--hopefully explains why a heartthrob like Hammer, a musician who probably wouldn't be caught dead with heartthrobs like Apple, and Willie Nelson would, as fate have it, all end up in the same jail in the same small Texas town. Oh and there's also the fact that, the town sits near the Mexican border which brings us to the next reason ...</p> <p> <strong><img alt="" src="http://cdn.theatlanticwire.com/img/upload/2012/09/21/rendered/b4c261c41c57b55148ac28a17d1a0e8c_350x244.jpg" data-original="http://cdn.theatlanticwire.com/img/upload/2012/09/21/Screen%20shot%202012-09-21%20at%203.30.32%20PM_.png">There's a Freaking Checkpoint Here</strong></p> <p> So this is <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.191622,-105.429675&amp;ll=31.191364,-105.430362&amp;spn=0.014795,0.019977&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=31.19141,-105.430495&amp;panoid=BrIQGIgFW8ETJuGNxEqk0A&amp;cbp=12,111.17,,0,-3.62">where I-10 comes into play</a>. "The highway is sending thousands of drug bust cases Sierra Blanca's way, courtesy of a Border Patrol checkpoint just outside of town where drug-sniffing dogs inspect more than 17,000 trucks, travelers &mdash; and tour buses &mdash; daily ..." wrote the <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/newupdated/ci_16717769">AP in January</a>. So, yeah, even though officials <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0921/How-Fiona-Apple-was-caught-carrying-hashish-in-West-Texas-video">told the AP</a> that it was one sensitive dog that busted Apple, that Border Checkpoint &nbsp;also did its part.&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>Texas Doesn't Care About Your Medical Marijuana License</strong></p> <p> The final piece in this puzzle as E!'s Gornstein reports, is that medical marijuana licenses in Texas are null and void. As <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/347561/why-fiona-apple-armie-hammer-and-other-stars-are-gettin-busted-for-pot-in-same-texas-town">Gornstein found ou</a>t, it's not like celebrities and other non-famous people don't try to get out of their sticky situations. "Ninety percent of the people out here will try to flash their medical marijuana cards," Rusty Fleming, public information officer for the Hudspeth County Sheriff's Office told E!.&nbsp;"Snoop flashed his real quick. But those don't matter to us. We're Texans. This isn't California!" &nbsp;</p> <p> So there you have it folks, if you go to Sierra Blanca with weed--you will get busted. <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2012/09/mathematical-explanation-why-we-love-gangnam-style/57041/">Lady Gaga</a>, consider yourself warned.</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23aec413/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23aceeee/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Centertainment0C20A120C0A90Cparis0Ehilton0Eloves0Egay0Epeople0Eshe0Eswears0C571190C/story01.htm">Paris Hilton Loves Gay People, She Swears</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad5fdb/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Centertainment0C20A120C0A90Cjk0Erowlings0Ehouse0Esale0Ewalmart0Edumps0Ekindle0C571250C/story01.htm">J.K.

We suggested it was one more meme the campaign <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/09/conservative-bloggers-are-losing-election/56966/">picked up from right-wing blogs</a>. But maybe it came from Romney's running mate.</p> <p> We noted a while back Paul Ryan <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/04/audio-surfaces-paul-ryans-effusive-love-ayn-rand/51711/">effusively praising</a>&nbsp;Ayn Rand in a 2005 speech to the Rand enthusiast organization The Atlas Society -- despite his later insistence that she wasn't all that important to him. But now <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/paul-ryans-ayn-rand-moment">more audio from that talk has emerged</a>, and Ryan also had some interesting things to say about Medicare and Social Security. He is not a fan. For instance: "Social Security right now is a collectivist system, it&rsquo;s a welfare transfer system." Privatizing the program by turning it into a giant 401(k) would mean that "every worker, every laborer in America will not only be a laborer but a capitalist. They will be an owner of society, they will be an owner and a participant of our free enterprise system, of our capitalist system."</p> <p> Ryan's Rand-loving pals pestered him for tips for how to sell libertarian ideas to members of Congress. Moderator Ed Hudgins asked "what&rsquo;s the most effective ammunition we have in our quiver...?" Ryan responded that it was attacking "collectivists" -- people who believe in guaranteed government benefits like Social Security -- with an "<a href="http://www.atlassociety.org/ele/blog/2012/04/30/paul-ryan-and-ayn-rands-ideas-hot-seat-again">victimization argument</a>." These "collectivists" talk down to people as victims in order to sell their programs, Ryan says. You can sell libertarian ideas by showing that their in the interest of the poor by saying they'll get richer with a stock&nbsp;<em>and</em> they are being demeaned by the status quo:</p> <blockquote> <p> I think the victimization argument -- I think the fact that collectivists speak down to people as victims is not only an arrogant thing to do, but it produces poor results. So backing up this victimization class that collectivists try to produce, and showing the folks you're trying to convince that this is not only in their worst interests, but it's not dignifying and it's arrogant [on behalf of the lawmakers]. That seems to work. ... I always try to show how victimhood has gotten them nothing and how freeing people produces great results.</p> </blockquote> <p> As <a href="http://www.nationalmemo.com/paul-ryan-pal-claiming-credit-for-romneys-47-percent-blowup/">National Memo's Joe Conason</a> points out, there's one guy who <i>wants</i> credit for Romney's comments: Charlie Sykes, author of <i>A Nation of Moochers.</i> (The book's thesis is clear from its title.)&nbsp;The book's Facebook page&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=516112478405084&amp;id=227501297266205">posted a note August 21</a> pointing to a blurb Sykes got from Paul Ryan himself.</p> <blockquote> <p> "Charlie Sykes&rsquo; <em>A Nation of Moochers</em> provides a much-needed wakeup call for a nation approaching two perilous tipping points: a moral one and a fiscal one. With our country facing unprecedented challenges and stark political choices, principled leaders will benefit from Sykes&rsquo; clear vision, keen insight and intellect. If we&rsquo;re serious about getting our nation back on track, then we would be wise to follow the lessons laid out in <em>A Nation of Moochers.</em>&rdquo; &ndash; Paul Ryan, Member of Congress</p> </blockquote> <p> On <a href="http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=507044795990298&amp;id=227501297266205">Tuesday</a>, Sykes celebrated the "47 percent" video, saying, "Of course, the MSM is treating this as if it were a horrific gaffe. But Romney appears to have been addressing the growing gap of the makers and the takers and the growing push to make more Americans dependent on the government."</p> <p> Maybe Ryan had an influence on Romney? Ryan and Romney reportedly <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/live-video-mitt-romney-announces-vp-pick-123251121.html">became close</a> when they campaigned together for a week before the Wisconsin primary on April 3. "The two wonks bonded during the Wisconsin primary and got even closer after," a Republican strategist told&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/2012-presidential-campaign/romney-and-ryan-a-matched-pair-go-after-obama-on-cbs-20120812"><em>National Journal</em></a> in August. Romney made his "47 percent" comment May 17.</p> <p> Ryan isn't talking like that now, of course. He told an <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/21/paul-ryan-to-seniors-obamacare-threatens-medicare-2/?hpt=hp_t2">AARP conference</a>&nbsp;on Friday that he wants those transfer payments to keep on transferring for years to come. "The first step to a stronger Medicare is to repeal Obamacare, because it represents the worst of both worlds," Ryan said. "It weakens Medicare for today&rsquo;s seniors and puts it at risk for the next generation."</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23af2c1d/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23a75abb/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cpolitics0C20A120C0A90Cdnc0Esuffering0Eslight0Ecash0Edisadvantage0C5710A40C/story01.htm">The DNC Is Suffering from a Slight Cash Disadvantage</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ab9260/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cpolitics0C20A120C0A90Cbill0Eclinton0Etells0Ejon0Estewart0Ehis0Espeech0Esecrets0C5710A80C/story01.htm">Bill Clinton Tells Jon Stewart His Speech Secrets</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad62a4/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cpolitics0C20A120C0A90Cnot0Eeveryones0Econvinced0Eromneys0Ereset0C571230C/story01.htm">Not Everyone's Convinced by Romney's Reset</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ae3ca3/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cpolitics0C20A120C0A90Canother0Eclue0Eabout0Ewho0Emade0E470Eromney0Evideo0C571340C/story01.htm">Another Clue About Who Made the 47% Romney Video</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ae4f9f/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cpolitics0C20A120C0A90Cromney0Epaid0E140Etaxes0Eyear0Eand0Ecould0Ehave0Epaid0Eeven0Eless0C571360C/story01.htm">Romney Paid 14% in Taxes This Year but Could Have Paid Less</a></li></ul></div><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Did+Mitt+Romney+Learn+His+%2747+Percent%27+Line+from+Paul+Ryan%3F&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fpolitics%2F2012%2F09%2Fdid-mitt-romney-learn-his-47-percent-line-paul-ryan%2F57132%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Did+Mitt+Romney+Learn+His+%2747+Percent%27+Line+from+Paul+Ryan%3F&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fpolitics%2F2012%2F09%2Fdid-mitt-romney-learn-his-47-percent-line-paul-ryan%2F57132%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540662219/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23af2c1d/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540662219/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23af2c1d/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144540662219/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23af2c1d/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/F_y0jU5jycs" height="1" width="1"></div><div>The Atlantic Wire<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/eZeUinASpu4/story01.htm>Everything You Need to Know About Why Apple Maps Problem Isn't Going Away Soon</a><p> Apple knows it has a Maps issue, but the company is saying, "the more people use it, the better it will get." Unfortunately, as mapping technology explains, that fix won't solve its location data problem very soon. A lot of the anger surrounding the new Maps app has to do with it just not knowing things. And, the theory from Apple, is that with more search queries from users, it can improve the Maps app, making it as good (if not better!) than the old Google-powered app that used to come with the iPhone.&nbsp;But, the issue, as Mike Dobson, the president of mapping consulting firm&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.telemapics.com/?page_id=104">TeleMapics</a>,&nbsp;explains it, the app's shortcomings are about "data quality," not quantity.&nbsp;</p> <p> Maps apps get made from a host of different sources, some technological (like <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-tomtom-apple-mapsbre88k0pt-20120921,0,1332626.story">Tom Tom</a>, which Apple has licensed for its app) and others human-made (like Google's Street View project). &nbsp;<em>The Atlantic</em>'s Alexis Madrigal <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/">had a great piece a couple weeks ago</a> explaining just how much goes into Google's mapping project. Dobson says that Apple's effort is currently inferior in both categories. On the tech side, <a href="http://blog.telemapics.com/?p=386">he suspects</a>&nbsp;(in a separate post)&nbsp;that Apple is getting its business listing data from <a href="http://www.directionsmag.com/pressreleases/acxiom174-introduces-new-web-based-analytical-and-mapping-tools/110625">Acxiom</a>, Yelp, and Localeze. Over the last few years, Apple also acquired other map related companies for the building of the app part: Placebase, C3, and Poly 9. And then, TomTom provides it with what he calls the "navigable map database" (the roads part), and in areas of the world where TomTom fails, they get their data from other suppliers with more specialized expertise.&nbsp;</p> <p> Apple's Maps is failing in part because, as Dobson explains it, these companies are "C-grade suppliers" of map data. (TomTom, for one, would take issue with that assessment. A <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-tomtom-apple-mapsbre88k0pt-20120921,0,1332626.story">representative told Reuters</a>, "We don't know what is causing the issues, but from our perspective the quality of our data is great and we stand behind it.") And data is where Apple thinks it can improve most easily, in part by collecting lots and lots of data from its users. But, for now, it only has a fraction of teh search data that Google has to draw on.</p> <p> But, the issues stem from more than just a lack of data: Apple has a people problem. On top of all the technology stuff, there is a team of human beings behind all maps,&nbsp;who iron out the kinks and turn the data into a whole product the works well together. (Right now Apple's human are "under lockdown ... working to fix it," says Apple.) Compared to Google, Apple's team is a joke in Dobson's book.&nbsp;Not only does Google have&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/Apple-Has-7-000-Fewer-People-Working-On-Maps-3883235.php">7,000 people</a>&nbsp;already working on mapping, but, the smaller contigent at Apple was not as involved in the map-making process. As <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/">Alexis Madrigal's piece</a> made clear, people make a huge difference when it comes to map quality. "The sheer amount of human effort that goes into Google's maps is just mind-boggling. Every road that you see slightly askew in the top image has been hand-massaged by a human," he wrote.</p> <p> Apple just doesn't have enough humans on hand to take that kind of care. For example: "Perhaps the most egregious error is that Apple&rsquo;s team relied on quality control by algorithm and not a process partially vetted by informed human analysis," writes Dobson. Google, on the other hand, has people driving around Street View cars not just to get Street View data, but to get a feel of how people in real life drive on streets. "Google learned that you cannot take the human out of the equation," adds Dobson. "While the mathematics of mapping appear relatively straight forward, I can assure you that if you take the informed human observer who possesses local and cartographic knowledge out of the equation that you will produce exactly what Apple has produced &ndash; A failed system."</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23aed169/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23a61c7d/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Cpoor0Esmokers0Enew0Eyork0Espend0E250Etheir0Eincome0Ecigarettes0C570A940C/story01.htm">Poor Smokers in New York Spend 25% of Their Income on Cigarettes</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23a62cda/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Capple0Elines0Edead0Elong0Elive0Eapple0Eline0C570A890C/story01.htm">The Apple Line's Dead, Long Live the Apple Line!</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23a6be39/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Cwell0Efinds0Eappropriate0Ebuyer0C5710A20C/story01.htm">The WELL Finds an Appropriate Buyer</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ac37a4/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Ciphone0E5s0Eare0Ehot0Eitem0Ethieves0C57110A0C/story01.htm">iPhone 5 Is a Hot Item for Thieves</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23acd6c3/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Cfacebook0Erealizes0Enobody0Ewants0Eshare0Eeverything0Eall0Etime0C5710A90C/story01.htm">Frictionless Sharing Hits the Skids at Facebook</a></li></ul></div><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Everything+You+Need+to+Know+About+Why+Apple+Maps+Problem+Isn%27t+Going+Away+Soon&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Ftechnology%2F2012%2F09%2Feverything-you-need-know-about-why-apple-maps-problem-isnt-going-away-soon%2F57127%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Everything+You+Need+to+Know+About+Why+Apple+Maps+Problem+Isn%27t+Going+Away+Soon&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Ftechnology%2F2012%2F09%2Feverything-you-need-know-about-why-apple-maps-problem-isnt-going-away-soon%2F57127%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608521371/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23aed169/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608521371/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23aed169/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608521371/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23aed169/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/eZeUinASpu4" height="1" width="1"></div><div>The Atlantic Wire<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/y3vRQJiGn3U/story01.htm>Romney Paid 14% in Taxes This Year but Could Have Paid Less</a><p> Mitt Romney <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/blogs/mitts-view/2012/09/note-trustee-brad-malt">will release </a>his 2011 tax return at 3p.m. this afternoon, and the campaign says the documents will show he paid a 14.1 percent tax rate in 2011. He reported income of $13.7 million. Romney claimed a deduction of $2.25 million in charitable contributions, even though he made slightly more than $4 million in charitable donations. <a href="https://twitter.com/felixsalmon/status/249201928091881473">Reuters' Felix Salmon</a> points out this kept Romney's tax rate above 13 percent. That's an curious decision, given that Romney said in a January Republican primary debate, "I pay all the taxes that are legally required and <a href="http://www.cfr.org/us-election-2012/republican-debate-transcript-tampa-florida-january-2012/p27180">not a dollar more</a>. I don't think you want someone as the candidate for president who pays more taxes than he owes." He <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-david-muir-interview-mitt-romney/story?id=16881787&amp;singlePage=true#.UFys4aRYv5Z">told ABC News</a> in July he wouldn't be "qualified" to be president if he paid more than he owed. Barack Obama <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/04/president-obama-has-higher-tax-rate-mitt-romney/51112/">paid a tax rate of 20.5 percent this year</a> on an adjusted gross income of $798,674.&nbsp;</p> <p> The Romneys charitable donations amounted to almost 30 percent of their income, a large increase compared to previous years. The campaign says over a 20-year period, the Romneys donated an average of 13.45 percent of their income to charity. At some point, the Romneys paid a higher tax rate. Over the 20-year period, the Romneys' federal effective tax rate was 20.2 percent. In no year did they pay no state or federal taxes.</p> <p> We'll be updating as more people sift through the documents. Here are some of the interesting things people are talking about right now:</p> <ul><li> <strong>Ryan uses an inhaler.</strong> The <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/sites/default/files/shared/pdr_dr_letter.pdf">health report for Paul Ryan</a>, released at the same time as the tax returns, shows that he has a "previously established diagnosis of airway hypersensitivity occasionally treated with an as needed albuterol inhaler." Ryan also has a history of a herniated disc and a medial meniscus injury in his right knee. Ryan's BMI is 20.</li> <li> <p> <strong>Romney is healthy. </strong>Mitt Romney's health report reveals he is allergic to penicillin. He takes low-dose aspirin and Lipitor. He lost his appendix in 1965. "He is a vigorous man who takes excellent care of his personal physical health."</p> </li> <li> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> Romney's resting heart rate is 40, Ryan's is 59. <strong>Jogging beats P90X.</strong></p> </li> <li> <strong>What Romney could have paid. </strong>The consensus seems to be that if Romney had deducted all of his charitable giving, his effective tax rate would be 12.1 percent, according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/froomkin/status/249211335139811328">Huffington Post's Dan Froomkin</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://twitter.com/GingerGibson/status/249215923922288640">Politico's Ginger Gibson</a>.</li> <li> <strong>Speculation about what he might not have paid. </strong>Just like when Romney released his 2010 tax returns, the lack of information led to <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/07/choose-your-own-romney-tax-return-adventure/54755/">a lot of sleuthing and&nbsp;hypothesizing</a>&nbsp;about what might be in his taxes, people are reading through the lines of the campaign's statement about his taxes. Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/nycsouthpaw/status/249210351281922049">@nycsouthpaw</a>&nbsp;wonders just how carefully worded the statement is. The campaign says "In each year during the entire 20-year period, the Romneys owed both state and federal income taxes," but it also says, "During the 20-year period covered by the PWC letter, Gov. and Mrs. Romney paid 100 percent of the taxes that they owed." Southpaw wonders whether this mean the Romneys didn't pay everything they owed in every year, but that it somehow averages out?</li> </ul><p> <img alt="" src="http://cdn.theatlanticwire.com/img/upload/2012/09/21/rendered/0fd3189ffc829867f8892694f111ceb6_600x271.jpg" data-original="http://cdn.theatlanticwire.com/img/upload/2012/09/21/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-21%20at%202.55.39%20PM.png"></p> <ul><li> <strong>Why did he do this? </strong>Republican consultant and former Romney '08 adviser&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/09/castellanos-on-tax-summary-is-this-a-joke-136321.html">Alex Castellanos tells Politico</a> he was shocked Romney decided to release a 20-year summary, after his campaign had already weathered controversy over his tax returns this spring.

Corn explains that the source "realized s/he would be in the room with a presidential candidate." Anyone who had been planning to attend a function with Romney wouldn't have "realized" they were going to be in the same room with him. They would have known.</p> <p> A Redditor had the same idea, writing: "I know you can't respond to this, but it seems pretty obvious that the recording was done by one of the catering staff."</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ae3ca3/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23a75abb/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cpolitics0C20A120C0A90Cdnc0Esuffering0Eslight0Ecash0Edisadvantage0C5710A40C/story01.htm">The DNC Is Suffering from a Slight Cash Disadvantage</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ab9260/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cpolitics0C20A120C0A90Cbill0Eclinton0Etells0Ejon0Estewart0Ehis0Espeech0Esecrets0C5710A80C/story01.htm">Bill Clinton Tells Jon Stewart His Speech Secrets</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad62a4/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cpolitics0C20A120C0A90Cnot0Eeveryones0Econvinced0Eromneys0Ereset0C571230C/story01.htm">Not Everyone's Convinced by Romney's Reset</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ae4f9f/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cpolitics0C20A120C0A90Cromney0Epaid0E140Etaxes0Eyear0Eand0Ecould0Ehave0Epaid0Eeven0Eless0C571360C/story01.htm">Romney Paid 14% in Taxes This Year but Could Have Paid Less</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23af2c1d/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cpolitics0C20A120C0A90Cdid0Emitt0Eromney0Elearn0Ehis0E470Epercent0Eline0Epaul0Eryan0C571320C/story01.htm">Did Mitt Romney Learn His '47 Percent' Line from Paul Ryan?</a></li></ul></div><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Another+Clue+About+Who+Made+the+47%25+Romney+Video&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fpolitics%2F2012%2F09%2Fanother-clue-about-who-made-47-romney-video%2F57134%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Another+Clue+About+Who+Made+the+47%25+Romney+Video&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fpolitics%2F2012%2F09%2Fanother-clue-about-who-made-47-romney-video%2F57134%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145605775803/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ae3ca3/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145605775803/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ae3ca3/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145605775803/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ae3ca3/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/W6bYCOrY0fM" height="1" width="1"></div><div>The Atlantic Wire<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/oSNjDZc5Q20/story01.htm>Hillary Clinton Is Taking a Shady Iranian Dissident Group Off the Terror List</a><p> After its extensive lobbying campaign in Washington, Hillary Clinton is going to de-list the Iranian dissident group&nbsp;Mujahedin-e-Khalq, or MEK, from the State Department's terror list in the next few days, <a href="http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/21/clinton-to-de-list-iranian-exile-group-from-terror-list/">reports CNN's Elise Labott</a>. The article cites a U.S. official saying "the decision is merited based on the record of facts that we have," but what the article doesn't cite is some of the more serious allegations lodged against the group, which every discussion about de-listing this group should include.&nbsp;</p> <p> <img alt="" src="http://cdn.theatlanticwire.com/img/upload/2012/09/21/rendered/d05237fdf9c23cd166c171114155687d_300x275.jpg" data-original="http://cdn.theatlanticwire.com/img/upload/2012/09/21/Screen%20shot%202012-09-21%20at%2011.58.12%20AM.png">For instance, did you know that in February <a href="http://rockcenter.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/02/09/10354553-israel-teams-with-terror-group-to-kill-irans-nuclear-scientists-us-officials-tell-nbc-news?lite">NBC News reported</a> that the MEK has been murdering &nbsp;Iranian nuclear scientists in broad daylight? &nbsp;The report by Richard Engel and Robert Windrem cited U.S. officials who said MEK members teamed up with Israelis to attach small magnetic bombs to the exterior of scientists' cars before detonating them. All told, five nuclear scientists since 2007 have been killed.&nbsp;But apparently the State Department doesn't buy that report, as they now tell&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-to-remove-iran-group-from-terror-list-officials-say/2012/09/21/ecfca30c-0401-11e2-8102-ebee9c66e190_story.html"><em>The Washington Post&nbsp;</em></a>that the group has "renounced violence and turned over its weapons to U.S. forces." Ok, then! What else do we know about this group?&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>Its origins. </strong>The MEK played a<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/09/21/us-to-take-iran-group-mek-off-terror-list-sources-say/"> significant role i</a>n overthrowing Iran's shah in the late '70s by assisting Islamic clerics. Then it turned against the new Iranian regime in the '80s and allied itself with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq war.&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>So how'd they become a terror group?&nbsp;</b>It was placed on State's terror list in 1997 after the deaths of six Americans in Iran in the '70s and an "<a href="http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/21/clinton-to-de-list-iranian-exile-group-from-terror-list/">attempted attack</a> against the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992." But since then it has publicly renounced violence, given up its arms and camped out in its long-time hangout in Iraq, a former military base called Camp Ashraf, which is near the border of Iran.&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>So how did they swoon the U.S. government?&nbsp;</strong>In short: a massive lobbying campaign and a big promise. We'll start with the lobbying. In November,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/us/politics/lobbying-support-for-iranian-exile-group-crosses-party-lines.html?pagewanted=all"><em>The New York Times'&nbsp;</em>Scott Shane</a> reported with great amazement that at a time of partisan gridlock, the one actor that was making things happen in Congress was this obscure Iranian exile group. He ticked off a laundry list of its American supporters. "The extraordinary lobbying effort to reverse the terrorist designation of the group ... has won the support of two former C.I.A. directors, R. James Woolsey and Porter J. Goss; a former F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh; a former attorney general, Michael B. Mukasey; President George W. Bush&rsquo;s first homeland security chief, Tom Ridge; President Obama&rsquo;s first national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones; big-name Republicans like the former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Democrats like the former Vermont governor Howard Dean; and even the former top counterterrorism official of the State Department, Dell L. Dailey, who argued unsuccessfully for ending the terrorist label while in office," wrote Shane. Those advocates were paid top dollar through speaking fees of $10,000 to $50,000 paid by the MEK and some were flown around to Paris, Berlin and Brussels for events. The above officials say they aren't motivated by money but humanitarian interests.&nbsp;</p> <p> Then there's the big promise. As&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-to-remove-iran-group-from-terror-list-officials-say/2012/09/21/ecfca30c-0401-11e2-8102-ebee9c66e190_story.html"><em>The Washington Post&nbsp;</em>reports, t</a>he MEK's hangout at Camp Ashraf in Iraq was becoming a problem both for the Iraqis and the U.S. &nbsp;"The decision ... hinged in part on the MEK&rsquo;s decision to leave its long-time home in Iraq, a former military base known as Camp Ashraf near the border with Iran," reports Joby Warrick. "Iraq had insisted on closing the base &mdash; by force, if necessary &mdash; and in recent years Iraqi police had clashed repeatedly with MEK members at the facility, killing dozens of them." So a deal of sorts surfaced that if the MEK left the camp, they could be de-listed from the terror list. But for months, the MEK dragged its feet until last week, when the U.S. warned it was blowing its chances at getting taken off the list. &ldquo;Friday and Saturday were all-nighters for a lot of our people as well as the U.N. folks,&rdquo; an official told <em>The Post</em>. In the end, an agreement was made between the U.S., Iraq and the MEK, which "effectively means the end of Camp Ashraf." And <i>voila!</i>&nbsp;that's the story of how a shady dissident group goes from being terrorists to pacifists.</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ae93b8/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ac3847/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Ctroop0Esurge0Eafghanistan0Eofficially0Eover0C571110C/story01.htm">The Troop Surge in Afghanistan Is Officially Over</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad0886/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Cbribing0Emexican0Eprison0Eguards0Eeasier0Edigging0Etunnel0C571150C/story01.htm">Bribing Mexican Prison Guards Is a Whole Lot Easier Than Digging a Tunnel</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad11e9/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Cassault0Eisrael0Eegypt0Eborder0Ekills0E10Esoldier0E30Eattackers0C571210C/story01.htm">Assault on Israel-Egypt Border Kills 1 Soldier, 3 Attackers</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad930e/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Ctimeline0Ebenghazi0Eattacks0C571240C/story01.htm">A Timeline of the Benghazi Attacks</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adfedd/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Canti0Eamerican0Eviolence0Epakistans0Efirst0Ecasualty0Ekfc0C571290C/story01.htm">Anti-American Violence Means No KFC for Pakistanis</a></li></ul></div><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Hillary+Clinton+Is+Taking+a+Shady+Iranian+Dissident+Group+Off+the+Terror+List&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fglobal%2F2012%2F09%2Fhillary-clinton-taking-shady-iranian-dissident-group-terror-list%2F57135%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Hillary+Clinton+Is+Taking+a+Shady+Iranian+Dissident+Group+Off+the+Terror+List&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fglobal%2F2012%2F09%2Fhillary-clinton-taking-shady-iranian-dissident-group-terror-list%2F57135%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540660199/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ae93b8/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540660199/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ae93b8/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144540660199/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ae93b8/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/oSNjDZc5Q20" height="1" width="1"></div><div>The Atlantic Wire<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/t2qsd8X5UvQ/story01.htm>What Do People Eat When They Have One Meal to Live?</a><p> Researchers at Cornell University&nbsp;<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2137856">studied the last meals of 247 death row inmates</a>&nbsp;to find out precisely what they ordered and how people handle nutrition when longterm health stops being a worry.&nbsp;They found that typical last meals are remarkably high in calories, high in protein and fat, and high in brandname foods. The average last meal has ("conservatively") 2,756 calories which is <a href="http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2012/07/15/death-row-inmate-goes-out-on-full-stomach-ingests-29000-calorie-last-meal/">way more</a> than the recommended amount of calories for adult during an entire day. Over 80 percent of the prisoners requested meat and two-thirds asked for something fried. Hardly anyone chose fruits or vegetables (or, oddly, pasta and pizza) and, somewhat surprisingly, around 20 percent didn't eat anything. One inmate requested <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2188411/From-solitary-olive-fast-food-binge-The-meals-death-row-inmates-recreated-photographed.html">a single pitted olive</a>.</p> <p> In other words, people choose comfort foods for their last meal. It's taken as a given that when people are upset or in stressful situations they both overeat and gravitate to dense, calorie-rich foods, like desserts and fried foods. The doomed prisoners also ordered way more than could eat, because there's no reason not to. Although,&nbsp;Texas banned the "all you can eat" last meal in 2011&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2040000/Texas-bans-meals-death-row-Lawrence-Russell-Brewer-execution.html">after one&nbsp;prisoners took it too far</a>.&nbsp;People presumably choose the branded foods, because they know exactly what they're getting and they won't be disappointed.</p> <p> That all seems pretty obvious, right? So why bother with the study all? Well, the last meal is a fascinating subject that has long captured imaginations.&nbsp;Artist Julia Ziegler-Haynes&nbsp;famously&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2188411/From-solitary-olive-fast-food-binge-The-meals-death-row-inmates-recreated-photographed.html">recreated the last meals of several death row prisoners</a> for a photo series &mdash; including the one above, eaten by Peter J. Miniel &mdash;&nbsp;that became a book called<em>&nbsp;Today's Special</em>. (You&nbsp;<a href="http://store.oh-wow.com/item.html/1363097">can buy it here</a>.) &nbsp;The paper even references previous studies of last meals of people who didn't know they were dying -- like fossilized&nbsp;Neanderthals&nbsp;and passengers on the <em>Titanic</em>.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;the researchers were looking at the effect of "mortality&nbsp;salience" on food choices. That is: "the degree to which people variably value and discount the future."</p> <p> If you know you have nothing to live for, then how do you behave? Among the researchers' conclusions was the&nbsp;suggestion&nbsp;that maybe doctors should avoid threatening patients with death and illness to get them to change their diet, because they will "counterintuitively engage in unhealthy overconsumption." If you think you're going to die prematurely (or are simply depressed about your weight), you might as well eat what makes you happy, right?</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adff68/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23aa9c0f/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Clife0Eexpectancy0Eshirnking0Esome0Ewhite0Epeople0C5710A60C/story01.htm">Life Expectancy Is Shrinking for Some White People</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ace776/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Crusty0Ehorse0Enfl0Ehelmets0Eand0Ejunot0Ediaz0C571120C/story01.htm">Rusty the Horse, NFL Helmets, and Junot D&iacute;az</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad112d/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Cfive0Ebest0Efriday0Ecolumns0C571160C/story01.htm">Five Best Friday Columns</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adbf1c/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Clabor0Elaw0Edoesnt0Eonly0Eapply0Eunpaid0Einterns0Ewho0Eare0Egood0Etheir0Ejobs0C571180C/story01.htm">Labor Laws Don't Just Apply to Unpaid Interns Who Are Good at Their Jobs</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adfd9d/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Cpittsburgh0Ehostage0Etaker0Eliveblogging0Ehis0Estandoff0Efacebook0C571310C/story01.htm">Pittsburgh Hostage-Taker Liveblogged Standoff on Facebook Before Surrender</a></li></ul></div><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=What+Do+People+Eat+When+They+Have+One+Meal+to+Live%3F&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fnational%2F2012%2F09%2Fwhat-do-people-eat-when-they-have-one-meal-live%2F57128%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=What+Do+People+Eat+When+They+Have+One+Meal+to+Live%3F&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fnational%2F2012%2F09%2Fwhat-do-people-eat-when-they-have-one-meal-live%2F57128%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540658769/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23adff68/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540658769/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23adff68/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144540658769/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23adff68/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/t2qsd8X5UvQ" height="1" width="1"></div><div>The Atlantic Wire<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/dpLzvl1YtNU/story01.htm>Anti-American Violence Means No KFC for Pakistanis</a><p> Anti-American sentiment has gotten <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/09/two-theaters-are-burned-down-new-protests-break-out-pakistan/57107/">so very serious in Pakistan</a> that the owners of that that shining beacons of American pride and joy, KFC, are shuttering their stores there.

"We have been in touch with our franchisee and fortunately all of our employees and their families are safe."</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adfedd/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ac3847/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Ctroop0Esurge0Eafghanistan0Eofficially0Eover0C571110C/story01.htm">The Troop Surge in Afghanistan Is Officially Over</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad0886/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Cbribing0Emexican0Eprison0Eguards0Eeasier0Edigging0Etunnel0C571150C/story01.htm">Bribing Mexican Prison Guards Is a Whole Lot Easier Than Digging a Tunnel</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad11e9/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Cassault0Eisrael0Eegypt0Eborder0Ekills0E10Esoldier0E30Eattackers0C571210C/story01.htm">Assault on Israel-Egypt Border Kills 1 Soldier, 3 Attackers</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad930e/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Ctimeline0Ebenghazi0Eattacks0C571240C/story01.htm">A Timeline of the Benghazi Attacks</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ae93b8/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Chillary0Eclinton0Etaking0Eshady0Eiranian0Edissident0Egroup0Eterror0Elist0C571350C/story01.htm">Hillary Clinton Is Taking a Shady Iranian Dissident Group Off the Terror List</a></li></ul></div><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Anti-American+Violence+Means+No+KFC+for+Pakistanis&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fglobal%2F2012%2F09%2Fanti-american-violence-pakistans-first-casualty-kfc%2F57129%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Anti-American+Violence+Means+No+KFC+for+Pakistanis&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fglobal%2F2012%2F09%2Fanti-american-violence-pakistans-first-casualty-kfc%2F57129%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540658709/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23adfedd/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144540658709/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23adfedd/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144540658709/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23adfedd/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/dpLzvl1YtNU" height="1" width="1"></div><div>The Atlantic Wire<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/-8ONNMolX_Y/story01.htm>Pittsburgh Hostage-Taker Liveblogged Standoff on Facebook Before Surrender</a><p> <em><strong>Update (1:52 p.m. EDT):</strong></em> The hostage-taker just surrendered and nobody was hurt, police said, via <a href="http://www.wtae.com/news/local/allegheny/Negotiations-continue-in-Gateway-Center-hostage-case-in-downtown-Pittsburgh/-/10927008/16687840/-/iim75gz/-/index.html">local station WTAE</a>.</p> <p> <em><strong>Original:</strong></em> The <a href="http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/21/police-gunman-holds-hostages-in-pittsburgh-high-rise/comment-page-2/">hostage situation unfolding in Pittsburgh on Friday</a> has a unique voice commenting on the action: That of the alleged hostage taker himself, who is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/11.Smallz.11">keeping his Facebook page updated</a> as police try to talk him into releasing the victims. "I cant take it no more im done bro," wrote Klein Michael Taxton, who police say&nbsp;walked into the 16th-floor offices of the employee benefits firm CW Breitsman Associates shortly after 8 a.m. on Friday, asked for a man there who hasn't been identified, and took him hostage, according to the <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_OFFICE_BUILDING_HOSTAGE_CALL?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-09-21-11-47-19">Associated Press's Joe Mandak</a>. The building in downtown Pittsburgh has been evacuated and the suspect, who police said had a military background, is reportedly calm. According to his Facebook page he's a graduate of <a href="http://www.triangle-tech.edu/">Triangle Tech</a>, a Pittsburg technical school, and works at a place called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Paulys-Car-Garage/214337855276628">Pauly's Car Garage</a>. His Facebook posts suggest someone upset but not suicidal. In one, he says goodbye to his father and sister, but not because he plans to die: "I'll live n jail," he wrote. His most recent came about an hour ago:</p> <blockquote> <p> -Fake mafukaz, thats the shyt i dnt like!</p> <p> -stop postn silly shyt bruh i aint laughin rite now nigga!</p> </blockquote> <p> Three hours ago his posted this farewell of sorts:</p> <blockquote> <p> -this life im livn rite now i dnt want anymore ive lost everything and i aint gettn it back instead of walkn around all broke n shyt while niggas stunt on me n shyt</p> <p> -welln pops youll never have to woryy about me again you'll nevr need to by me anything no need to ever waste ur hard earned money on me. i'll live n jail you dnt want me around anymore thats kool bye...i love u assata sis</p> <p> -how this ends is up to yall bro real shyt</p> <p> -i cant take it no more im done bro</p> </blockquote> <p> Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/11.Smallz.11/posts/423240674400300?comment_id=4393599&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=5">some tried to talk him down</a>:</p> <p> <img alt="" src="http://cdn.theatlanticwire.com/img/upload/2012/09/21/rendered/dfc206bcba29a8f6823ff2b3ad9f45fa_623x406.jpg" data-original="http://cdn.theatlanticwire.com/img/upload/2012/09/21/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-21%20at%2012.54.52%20PM.png"></p> <p> Thaxton also posted his phone number, but a call there went straight to voicemail, which was full. He's obviously becoming something of a phenomenon because his Facebook page says he has too many friend requests to accept any more.

Some Alternate Definitions of Chickification</a><p> Alert! <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/hillaryreinsberg/rush-limbaugh-male-genitalia-are-shrinking-becaus">Rush Limbaugh said something ridiculous and offensive again</a>. (Why we continue to listen to him is unknown to this writer, but he said something and people are upset, so we will discuss it.) <a href="http://mediamatters.org/video/2012/09/20/limbaugh-male-private-parts-are-shrinking-becau/190034">On his show yesterday,</a> Limbaugh mentions a story out of<a href="http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2012/09/19/italian-study-shows-male-genitalia-is-shrinking/"> CBS News Philadelphia</a> that cites an Italian study determining that "the average size of a penis is roughly 10 percent smaller than it was 50 years ago." The researchers blame air pollution and global warming for this. Charming Rush says, no, clearly, it's due to feminism, feminazis, "the chickification," and "everything else."&nbsp;</p> <p> <em>Chickification:</em> This is a term he's<a href="http://mediamatters.org/video/2009/09/16/limbaugh-complains-about-the-chickification-of/154649"> thrown around a bunch</a>; he appears to be the coiner of the phrase, and he loves it, clearly, considering it some sort of powerful way to demean women. But for having made it up, he's still rather unclear about what it means. Something bad, we suppose? And why should we take his word for what <em>chickification</em> is, anyway? He's hardly an expert on the topic. Here are some better definitions.</p> <p> <strong>chick&middot;i&middot;fi&middot;ca&middot;tion</strong>&nbsp;<em>noun</em>&nbsp;\&#712;chik-(&#601;-)f&#601;-&#712;k&#257;-sh&#601;n\</p> <p> Definition of&nbsp;<em>CHICKIFICATION</em></p> <p> <strong>1&nbsp;a </strong><b>:&nbsp;</b>the making of baby domestic&nbsp;<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chicken">chickens</a>&nbsp;or the young of any bird, whether naturally or unnaturally or as store-bought or hand-made Peeps, or the using of such products to decorate one's environment.&nbsp;<em>Examples:</em> "Chickification begins on the farm in the spring."&nbsp;"I've purchased my Easter candies. The chickification of my kitchen counter is complete!"&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>b :</strong>&nbsp;To consume too many Peeps (see above). Note: This only works with the traditionally shaped Peeps, the ones that look like, you know, chicks&mdash;the bunny ones entail "bunnification." <em>Example: </em>"Holy <em>chickification</em> that's a sugar rush!"&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>2:</strong> To make like a chick, i.e., yellow and fuzzy and adorable, say for Halloween or a costume party. Example: "I've <em>chickified</em> myself to go to Rob's annual dress-up hootenanny!" If dressing up as a full-grown chicken, use <em>chickenification</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>3 a :</strong>&nbsp;To purchase much chick-lit, with which you adorn your bookcase and home. "Gulliver insisted upon equal parts <em>dudification </em>and <em>chickification </em>of the library, for he enjoyed war novels as much as he did romances."</p> <p> <strong>b :</strong> To watch many chick flicks, as above, i.e., "the <em>chickification</em> of one's television."&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>c :</strong><em> nonstandard:</em> To chew chiclets for fresh breath and "the <em>chicification</em> of one's mouth." (Note alternative spelling.)</p> <p> <strong>4. </strong>To make awesome through lady-ness or by being a woman, or by the hands, hearts, minds, and bodies of such. <em>Examples: </em>"That drab old boardroom formerly filled by men has experienced a great&nbsp;<em>chickification</em> through the hiring of various intelligent, powerful, and also quite elegant women." "By having babies, women allow for the chickification of America." "We chickified <em>chickification,&nbsp;</em>which was never Rush Limbaugh's word to own, anyway."</p> <p> <strong>Synonyms:</strong>&nbsp;ladyification, womanlimaking, girlified, feminization, simply-the-way-we-live, adorable and cute like a baby chicken or a Peep. <em>See also:</em> Peepsification.</p> <p> <strong>Antonyms:</strong>&nbsp;Rush Limbaughing, trolling</p> <p> <strong>Rhymes with&nbsp;<em>CHICKIFICATION: </em></strong>wickification, tickification, gification, staycation, ladyamacation, Mentos-ification, womanization.</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adbf19/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23aceeee/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Centertainment0C20A120C0A90Cparis0Ehilton0Eloves0Egay0Epeople0Eshe0Eswears0C571190C/story01.htm">Paris Hilton Loves Gay People, She Swears</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad5fdb/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Centertainment0C20A120C0A90Cjk0Erowlings0Ehouse0Esale0Ewalmart0Edumps0Ekindle0C571250C/story01.htm">J.K.

In court documents unearthed by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jtes/the-woman-who-could-bring-down-fashion-internships">Buzzfeed's Jessica Testa</a>, senior accessories editor Sam Broekema wrote that Wang's bad&nbsp;behavior included "repeatedly provided interns with the wrong address for a pick-up or return," and covering up those mistakes instead of alerting her supervisors. He also said she risked losing or breaking the magazine's expensive merchandise and had&nbsp;overall bad performance that led to a talking-to at some point during her stint.</p> <p> But as Wagoner argues, no matter how awful she was, Wang still deserved to be paid under the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm">Fair Labor and Standards Act</a>. Since the case hinges on whether unpaid interns are employees (who must legally be paid) or there to learn (and thus no pay), it seems odd that Hearst would get into Wang's poor on-the-job performance, since that seems to suggest their interns have a job to do and not just soaking up education.&nbsp;</p> <p> Wang's lawsuit <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2012/09/unpaid-interns-lawsuit-hasnt-changed-game-hearst/56734/">has so far had little effect on the culture at Hearst</a>, which sounds particularly brutal: "The magazine's editor-in-chief, Glenda Bailey, has an intern meet her at her car every day to carry her handbag up," a former intern told Testa. But, future<em> Harper's Bazaar </em>interns looking to get paid shouldn't give up yet. Though only three other interns have joined the class action at this point, that's because notice hasn't gone out to the other 3,000 possible plaintiffs yet, Wagoner explained to The Atlantic Wire. "We are waiting on the court to order the form of notice," explained Wagoner. "Then, the court orders will go out to thousands of former Hearst interns and people will have an opportunity to join," she said.&nbsp;After that point, the case will proceed.</p> <p> The court will decide if interns are employees by the end of 2012 or early 2013, at which point we could expect Wang's case to have real effects.* "We feel pretty confident that [when] the court is in a position to rule on the evidence, it will find that interns are employees," Wagoner told The Atlantic Wire. In that case, she says Hearst would have to offer back-pay and ultimately "it would have ramifications on Hearst's internship program." That could lead to various outcomes, including getting rid of the internship program altogether. Of course, at that point Hearst could appeal. Or they might win, who knows. For now, however, Wang and future Hearst interns just have to wait.&nbsp;</p> <p> <em>*This post originally&nbsp;misstated&nbsp;when the court would decide on the case.&nbsp;</em></p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adbf1c/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23aa9c0f/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Clife0Eexpectancy0Eshirnking0Esome0Ewhite0Epeople0C5710A60C/story01.htm">Life Expectancy Is Shrinking for Some White People</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ace776/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Crusty0Ehorse0Enfl0Ehelmets0Eand0Ejunot0Ediaz0C571120C/story01.htm">Rusty the Horse, NFL Helmets, and Junot D&iacute;az</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad112d/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Cfive0Ebest0Efriday0Ecolumns0C571160C/story01.htm">Five Best Friday Columns</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adfd9d/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Cpittsburgh0Ehostage0Etaker0Eliveblogging0Ehis0Estandoff0Efacebook0C571310C/story01.htm">Pittsburgh Hostage-Taker Liveblogged Standoff on Facebook Before Surrender</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adff68/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Cwhat0Edo0Epeople0Eeat0Ewhen0Ethey0Ehave0Eone0Emeal0Elive0C571280C/story01.htm">What Do People Eat When They Have One Meal to Live?</a></li></ul></div><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Labor+Laws+Don%27t+Just+Apply+to+Unpaid+Interns+Who+Are+Good+at+Their+Jobs&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fnational%2F2012%2F09%2Flabor-law-doesnt-only-apply-unpaid-interns-who-are-good-their-jobs%2F57118%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Labor+Laws+Don%27t+Just+Apply+to+Unpaid+Interns+Who+Are+Good+at+Their+Jobs&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fnational%2F2012%2F09%2Flabor-law-doesnt-only-apply-unpaid-interns-who-are-good-their-jobs%2F57118%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608516198/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23adbf1c/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608516198/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23adbf1c/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608516198/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23adbf1c/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/awBbUCNKW28" height="1" width="1"></div><div>The Atlantic Wire<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/eTOunhWCzZM/story01.htm>Cindy Adams Sees So Many Things</a><p> <em>The New York Post</em>'s esteemed columnist, social reporter, and seer of things Cindy Adams, recently went on a stroll around her Manhattan neighborhood and decided to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/city_full_but_lonely_j0qnjQiP81v9uPRnQV4PsI">write about what she saw</a>.

And if you look at state polls that contact cell phone users, Obama is leading by about six points in swing states.</p> <p> Then there are the fundraising numbers. Romney <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/09/romney-fundraising-slowed-august/57100/">raised</a> $66 million in August, which is a lot of money, but is a lot less than the $100 million he raised in June and July. Romney beat Obama by a significant margin those months, but in August, Obama raised almost $85 million.&nbsp;Plus, Romney seems to have a problem with small donors. Thirty percent of Obama's haul came from checks under $200, but for Romney, the share was 14 percent, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/romney-campaign-hits-a-financal-snag/2012/09/20/b31c568c-0334-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_story.html"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>&nbsp;notes.&nbsp;But there's trouble among some wealthy donors too.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/us/politics/cash-low-romney-striving-to-find-new-large-donors.html"><i>The New York Times</i>' Nicholas Confessore</a> explains that 32,000 donors gave Romney the max amount in the primary, but haven't yet donated for the general election.</p> <p> Then there's the effect Romney's struggles seem to be having on Republicans elsewhere, particularly in tight Senate races. On Thursday, Wisconsin's Tommy Thompson blamed his lower poll numbers on Romney, telling a <a href="http://www.wkow.com/story/19585691/baldwin-leads-in-latest-marquette-poll#.UFpx4XGWFo8.facebook">local TV station</a>, "&nbsp;If your standard-bearer for the presidency is not doing well, it's gonna reflect on the down-ballot." Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown said of his opponent Elizabeth Warren,&nbsp;"I know she'd like to run against Mitt Romney, but she's running against me,"&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rollcall.com/issues/58_23/Mitt-Romneys-Incredible-Shrinking-Coattails-217709-1.html?pos=hln"><em>Roll Call</em>'s Shira Toeplitz</a> reports.</p> <p> Aside from the things measurable by math, another concern is a message centered on gaffe matching.&nbsp;Romney's new strategy appears to have a major emphasis on gaffe matching with President Obama's campaign. The "47 percent" video was matched with a Drudge Report-released video of <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/09/half-obamas-redistribution-video-romney-and-drudge-ignored/57065/">Obama saying in 1998</a> that he believes in redistribution. The Romney campaign has been called slow to respond, but on Thursday, it <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/09/obama-doesnt-think-he-can-change-washington-after-all/57095/">incorporated an Obama gaffe</a> into Romney's stump speech an hour after Obama said it.&nbsp;</p> <p> <em>National Review</em>'s Ponnuru is not convinced:</p> <blockquote> <p> In recent days the Romney campaign has seized on evidence that Obama has spoken favorably of &ldquo;redistribution.&rdquo; If the argument is that Obama knows no way to help people other than forcible transfers of money, then it&rsquo;s one worth making. If it&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s an un-American socialist, it seems rather less promising.</p> </blockquote> <p> Even Herman Cain offers this low blow, considering the source.

What happened next has still not been established.&nbsp;Obama administration officials say that around 8 p.m.. a mob of Muslim protesters gathered around the U.S. consulate to protest the U.S. film <em>Innocence of Muslims</em>. Yesterday, however,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGMlnBkUztM">CBS News reported</a>&nbsp;that witnesses at the scene say there was never an anti-American protest outside the consulate.

The map on the right shows a Google satellite image of the consulate.&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>9:30 p.m.&nbsp;</strong>The attackers arrive, approaching the consulate from three sides, armed with rocket-propelled grenades.

"They fire rocket-propelled grenades into the main building. Mr. Stevens, [computer technician] Sean Smith and an American security officer are inside," reports <em>The Times</em>. "The security officer makes it outside. He returns to rescue the others and finds Mr. Smith dead but does not find Mr. Stevens." At 10 p.m., the consulate is burning in flames and, according to <i>the Journal,&nbsp;</i>the security officer was joined by&nbsp;Libyan government reinforcements who just arrived. "They guard front and rear gates as militants begin to crowd at rear gate. U.S. and Libyan guards enter burning building." The guards were also unable to find Ambassador Stevens.</p> <p> <strong>10:45 p.m. </strong>At this point, American security personnel try to take back the main building of the consulate but fail.

Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both American security officers, were killed in the shootout.

According to the real estate listing, the house is located in "one of Edinburgh's most exclusive conservation areas," and is sealed off by a "discreet landscaped and walled garden."

The mega-retailer has announced that it will no longer sell major competitor Amazon's e-readers. At issue is the Kindle Fire HD's built-in Amazon store, which allows readers to purchase all kinds of products while they pause between e-chapters. That feature has made physical chains mad, and Target decided to stop selling Kindles last spring. Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst for Forrester Research, calls the Kindle, "a little bit of a Trojan horse" and believes stores like WalMart "should have made this decision to not carry the Kindle a long time ago."&nbsp;Apple iPads and other e-readers will remain on sale at WalMart stores.

Since British actress Emma Thompson is now dipping into writing, let's egg on a possible spat between her and French provacateur&nbsp;Michel Houellebecq. In Thompson's interview with&nbsp;<em>The New York Times Book Review</em>, she says his novel&nbsp;<em>The Elementary Particles</em>&nbsp;was so unusually cruel, "I hurled the book across the room and would have hurled Michel too, had he been in reach." She also calls out entire genres, saying that she can't be bothered with horror. "I can&rsquo;t manage it. I become &mdash; well &mdash; horrified. Self-help books have a similar effect."&nbsp;[<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/books/review/emma-thompson-by-the-book.html?_r=1&amp;ref=books&amp;pagewanted=all"><em>The New York Times</em></a>]</p> <p> <b>Books-a-Million charged with wrongful termination</b>.

"For some time, Books-A-Million has made it known to our client that the company did not support his service to the U.S. Navy," says Markham's lawyer Mark White.&nbsp;Markham went on active duty for the first half of 2009.

Millions of old books remain unavailable, either physically or on digital platforms. Re-printing isn't feasible for all titles, but the lowered production costs of putting together an e-book re-release could be a huge boon for the publishing industry. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon studied sales figures for out-of-print titles recently revived as e-books, and they predict digitizing old 2.7 million old books would result in profits of over $400 million within one year. So what's holding publishers back? As we noted in the <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2012/09/pure-white-and-deadly-mystery-solved-why-publishing-cant-catch-surefire-hit/56635/">case of&nbsp;<em>Pure, White and Deadly</em></a>, sorting out who holds the rights to old books can be massively time-consuming. "Every contract is unique," says publishing consultant Mike Shatzkin. If every out-of-print title were to be listed on Amazon as an e-book tomorrow, the profits would be plentiful. But just getting them there is usually a sluggish process.&nbsp;[<a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/spend/technology/can-amazon-turn-outofprint-books-into-gold-1348177023955/"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>]</p> <p> <strong>A note on lists</strong>.

Specifically: "Gay guys are the horniest people in the world. They're disgusting. Dude, most of them probably have AIDS...I would be so scared if I was a gay guy. You'll like, die of AIDS." So that is pretty bad! But, Paris insists, she wasn't talking about all gay people. She was just having a conversation with a gay friend about "a website" (we take this to mean hookup smartphone app Grindr) that enables promiscuity or whatever. It was a private conversation that some weird taxi driver recorded for some unknown reason and she didn't mean it. She's issued a long statement, via GLAAD, saying that she loves gay people. "As anyone close to me knows, I always have been and always will be a huge supporter of the gay community. I am so sorry and so upset that I caused pain to my gay friends, fans and their families with the comments heard this morning." She goes on to say that of course AIDS affects everyone, not just gay people, and that gay people are "the strongest people I know." All right, fine. Sincere or not, let's accept it and move on with our lives. Enough talking about Paris Hilton. Though, we have to say, it is interesting that she said "gay friends, fans, and their families" but not "gay family members." Because, y'know, we, uh, <a href="http://www.queerty.com/did-paris-hiltons-brother-barron-star-in-a-hardcore-gay-sex-tape-beloved-by-male-models-20111201/">hear she might have one</a>.

Are WABC New York news anchor Liz Cho and <em>Good Morning America</em> news anchor Josh Elliott an item? Everyone who cares, so about six people, says yessss. Cho recently split up with her husband and moved out of their "Yonkers mansion" &mdash; which, what? I guess that's the only way to live in Yonkers? Like, why live in Yonkers if you're not going to live in a mansion? But also, why live in a mansion if it's in Yonkers? I'd take an East Village one bedroom over a Yonkers mansion any day &mdash; and into an apartment on West 90th Street, and Elliott has been seen leaving the building, sometimes <em>in the morning</em>. Meaning they had a sleepover, maybe. Like a wink wink, nudge nudge, didn't get much sleep kind of a sleepover. You know, because they stayed up all night watching <em>Now and Then</em> and eating candy and pizza. Sleepover stuff! Anyway, the couple who are so in love and will probably be married soon have denied being a couple that is going to grow old together, saying they are "just friends." And we all know what that means. It means they're friends... with benefits. Yup. ABC has a pretty comprehensive benefits package for its employees, especially its on-air talent.

Troubled Amanda Bynes, she of the constant car wrecks and odd behaviors, has reportedly been dropped by all of her "people," meaning her agent, her publicist, and her lawyer. Supposedly all of these people tried to reach out to her over the past few weeks but she was unresponsive so they eventually decided that "they can't help someone that doesn't want to be helped," according to TMZ. Which is sad. And, y'know, troubling. Hopefully some sane, sober adults are still sticking around in case she decides to reach out. Maybe someone from her Nickelodeon days? Anyway, this story doesn't seem to be getting better, does it.

That's the one where the girls are actually all pretty rich and there are the two former child actor sisters who are one day going to kill each other in a final battle on a windswept hilltop. This season involves a new Housewife, some blonde lady nobody likes (or Kyle likes, I don't know), lots of stuff with the husbands yelling at each other like house cats, and a mansion burning down. Yeah there's a big mansion fire set piece that probably cost them millions but looks great in the trailers and will be an exciting climax. This thing trundles onto the airwaves on November 5th, so gird your loins or don't bother and don't watch it, see if I care.

There's also some text about what he looks for in a girl that includes the word "servant" in a creepy way. (He's talking about being a servant to God, not wanting a girl to be his servant, but still the word "servant" is a creepy word no matter what.) But mostly it's Tim Tebow pushing a gigantic tire without his shirt on. Meanwhile, first-string Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez will have a letter to the editor published in this Sunday's <em>Parade</em> magazine.

Calvin Klein don't care, though. He's just keepin' on keepin' on, content with his mind-boggling pile of money and probably other boyfriends. He's Calvin Klein for god's sake! He picks up the phone and dials one number and before you can say "blue jeans" there's the entire Hollister fall catalogue waiting at his door. Nick Gruber doesn't matter. Who cares.

Hemsworth was doing the driving and was apparently wearing "board shorts." Some kid driving around in a $200,000 automobile while wearing freaking board shorts should be reason enough for every poor person in the world to get on a boat or just walk over from the next town and burn this country to the ground. Also this seems like a subtle F-you to fellow child star Amanda Bynes, who isn't even allowed to <em>look</em> at a car anymore. Don't be a show off, Miley. You should be driving around in an old jalopy. That's what you've earned. Some day you might earn a Volkswagen maybe, but for now it's the jalopy. Return that expensive car and use the money to, I don't know, do something remotely valuable.

But "at some point, however, the bigger, more powerful country - - the one that has &ldquo;stood up&rdquo; -- will have to take the risk of breaking the stalemate with a bold and generous initiative."</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad112d/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23aa9c0f/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Clife0Eexpectancy0Eshirnking0Esome0Ewhite0Epeople0C5710A60C/story01.htm">Life Expectancy Is Shrinking for Some White People</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ace776/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Crusty0Ehorse0Enfl0Ehelmets0Eand0Ejunot0Ediaz0C571120C/story01.htm">Rusty the Horse, NFL Helmets, and Junot D&iacute;az</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adbf1c/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Clabor0Elaw0Edoesnt0Eonly0Eapply0Eunpaid0Einterns0Ewho0Eare0Egood0Etheir0Ejobs0C571180C/story01.htm">Labor Laws Don't Just Apply to Unpaid Interns Who Are Good at Their Jobs</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adfd9d/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Cpittsburgh0Ehostage0Etaker0Eliveblogging0Ehis0Estandoff0Efacebook0C571310C/story01.htm">Pittsburgh Hostage-Taker Liveblogged Standoff on Facebook Before Surrender</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adff68/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cnational0C20A120C0A90Cwhat0Edo0Epeople0Eeat0Ewhen0Ethey0Ehave0Eone0Emeal0Elive0C571280C/story01.htm">What Do People Eat When They Have One Meal to Live?</a></li></ul></div><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Five+Best+Friday+Columns&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fnational%2F2012%2F09%2Ffive-best-friday-columns%2F57116%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Five+Best+Friday+Columns&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fnational%2F2012%2F09%2Ffive-best-friday-columns%2F57116%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608513781/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ad112d/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608513781/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ad112d/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608513781/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ad112d/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/Emz3w-MPcQg" height="1" width="1"></div><div>The Atlantic Wire<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/yQ9FMhayZMw/story01.htm>Frictionless Sharing Hits the Skids at Facebook</a><p> One year into its quest to get us to passively share everything with each other all the time, it's starting to sink in at Facebook that people aren't very interested in bringing radical transparency to their digital lives. A sign of the times: at a panel yesterday, Facebook's manager of media partnerships, Andy Mitchell, explained that the company no longer thinks the future of the Internet is "passive sharing," <a href="https://twitter.com/lheron/status/248971281763037184">tweeted Liz Heron</a>, director of social media and engagement at <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, adding that Mitchell said the "user feedback" was "not strong." It's just one tweet from one digital panel, but it's still surprising to hear that anyone at Facebook is willing to publicly acknowledge that people are reluctant to share after the social network has been going so strongly in an always be sharing direction.</p> <p> From the beginning people pushed back against this idea. <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/09/not_sharing_is_caring.html">Slate's Farhad Manjoo called</a> it a "terrible plan." "This is a nightmare ...&nbsp;Facebook is killing taste," he wrote, explaining that removing the choice from sharing, makes it seem like we approve of everything we, read, or listen to. "It eliminates the&nbsp;<em>curation</em>&nbsp;aspect of our self-presentations," <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/09/the-problem-with-facebooks-new-frictionless-sharing/245578/">added Philip Bump at&nbsp;<em>The Atlantic</em></a>. "It would be as though I told everyone that I was wearing blue jeans and a somewhat worse-for-wear t-shirt right now in addition to revealing that earlier today I wore a sharp, tailored suit. Both are accurate, but only one is the impression I'd like to leave with people." <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/how-frictionless-sharing-could-undermine-your-legal-right-to-privacy/254277/">Others</a> had <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/09/inevitable-friction-facebooks-frictionless-sharing/43111/">privacy qualms</a>. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/06/27/spotify-scares-off-facebook-oversharer/">Some</a> (<a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/02/cocktail-crossfire-online-privacy-really-big-deal/49087/">including me</a>) just didn't want to participate.&nbsp;</p> <p> Unlike other abhorred Facebook missives, however, the unpopularity of this hasn't gone away. When Spotify said it would require this frictionless sharing, it quickly added a "privacy sharing" option, following user backlash. And it's the bright spot in the social sharing space, as many people still mindlessly share their tune-choices. Other efforts to build apps and services that spew out social updates have been less successful. Stats from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/08/music-app-stats/">TechCrunch</a> showed "meager increases" in usage from other music apps that facilitated frictionless sharing. Social reading, by which links to stories you've read would appear as status updates, has had mixed reception. Anecdotal evidence (from some of the <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/facebook-social-readers-are-all-collapsing">Internet's loudest</a>&nbsp;complainers) suggested that people really hated the idea. "So gratifying to see 'social readers' go away. Terrible idea, badly executed," <a href="https://twitter.com/pkafka/statuses/199593225999224832">tweeted</a> AllThingsD's Peter Kafka, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/facebook-social-readers-are-all-collapsing">after Buzzfeed's John Herrman noted data showing falling user rates</a>. At the time, Facebook <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/05/facebook-social-reader-stinks-less-previously-thought/52063/">attributed</a> these numbers to a change in its news feed algorithm. But, Herrman notes the trends haven't changed.&nbsp;</p> <p> Now, after months of it not working, Facebook is finally admitting its all-in approach isn't the best way to do things. The site has said it will continue to work with publishers and companies, but not to build these frictionless sharing apps. Instead it will encourage "activity more similar to that of the share and Like buttons" -- things that require active clicks -- Facebook spokesperson Malorie Lucich&nbsp;told Herrman. "We're committed to making media sites more social, while balancing the best way of driving distribution for these sites and helping people discover great content through friends," Lucich continued.&nbsp;</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23acd6c3/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23a61c7d/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Cpoor0Esmokers0Enew0Eyork0Espend0E250Etheir0Eincome0Ecigarettes0C570A940C/story01.htm">Poor Smokers in New York Spend 25% of Their Income on Cigarettes</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23a62cda/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Capple0Elines0Edead0Elong0Elive0Eapple0Eline0C570A890C/story01.htm">The Apple Line's Dead, Long Live the Apple Line!</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23a6be39/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Cwell0Efinds0Eappropriate0Ebuyer0C5710A20C/story01.htm">The WELL Finds an Appropriate Buyer</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ac37a4/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Ciphone0E5s0Eare0Ehot0Eitem0Ethieves0C57110A0C/story01.htm">iPhone 5 Is a Hot Item for Thieves</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23aed169/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Ceverything0Eyou0Eneed0Eknow0Eabout0Ewhy0Eapple0Emaps0Eproblem0Eisnt0Egoing0Eaway0Esoon0C571270C/story01.htm">Everything You Need to Know About Why Apple Maps Problem Isn't Going Away Soon</a></li></ul></div><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Frictionless+Sharing+Hits+the+Skids+at+Facebook&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Ftechnology%2F2012%2F09%2Ffacebook-realizes-nobody-wants-share-everything-all-time%2F57109%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Frictionless+Sharing+Hits+the+Skids+at+Facebook&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Ftechnology%2F2012%2F09%2Ffacebook-realizes-nobody-wants-share-everything-all-time%2F57109%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608326474/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23acd6c3/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608326474/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23acd6c3/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608326474/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23acd6c3/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/yQ9FMhayZMw" height="1" width="1"></div><div>The Atlantic Wire<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/4f-y5fNeh5E/story01.htm>Rusty the Horse, NFL Helmets, and Junot Díaz</a><p> <em>Now that&nbsp;</em>The New York Times<em>&nbsp;pay wall is live, you only get&nbsp;<b>10 free clicks</b>&nbsp;a month.

Three prisoners in Monday's jailbreak in Piedras Negras, Mexico have been captured and revealed that their escape was actually mundane: it was aided by prison guards who were bribed by the Zetas drug cartel. "There was total complicity, collusion and betrayal from the officers charged with preventing them from escaping," said the public security secretary of Coahuila Jorge Luis Moran<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19672991">&nbsp;according to the BBC</a>. On Monday, those "officers charged with preventing them from escaping" told journalists this tall tale of their prisoners escaping through a <a href="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/63027000/jpg/_63027994_63027993.jpg">shabby looking tunnel</a>, when in reality, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/20/world/americas/mexico-prison-break/index.html">as CNN's Marilia Brochetto reports</a>, Mexican officials found that those inmates literally used the prison's front door. "Authorities arrested 16 employees, including the prison director, after the escape," <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/20/world/americas/mexico-prison-break/index.html">Brochetto reports</a>.&nbsp;There's no word yet on whether it was the prisoners or the guards who dug the just-for-show tunnel, but Mexican officials (who presumably aren't of the bribing variety) say the Zetas drug cartel was behind the massive jailbreak.&nbsp;</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad0886/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ac3847/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Ctroop0Esurge0Eafghanistan0Eofficially0Eover0C571110C/story01.htm">The Troop Surge in Afghanistan Is Officially Over</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad11e9/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Cassault0Eisrael0Eegypt0Eborder0Ekills0E10Esoldier0E30Eattackers0C571210C/story01.htm">Assault on Israel-Egypt Border Kills 1 Soldier, 3 Attackers</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad930e/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Ctimeline0Ebenghazi0Eattacks0C571240C/story01.htm">A Timeline of the Benghazi Attacks</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adfedd/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Canti0Eamerican0Eviolence0Epakistans0Efirst0Ecasualty0Ekfc0C571290C/story01.htm">Anti-American Violence Means No KFC for Pakistanis</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ae93b8/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Chillary0Eclinton0Etaking0Eshady0Eiranian0Edissident0Egroup0Eterror0Elist0C571350C/story01.htm">Hillary Clinton Is Taking a Shady Iranian Dissident Group Off the Terror List</a></li></ul></div><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Bribing+Mexican+Prison+Guards+Is+a+Whole+Lot+Easier+Than+Digging+a+Tunnel&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fglobal%2F2012%2F09%2Fbribing-mexican-prison-guards-easier-digging-tunnel%2F57115%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Bribing+Mexican+Prison+Guards+Is+a+Whole+Lot+Easier+Than+Digging+a+Tunnel&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fglobal%2F2012%2F09%2Fbribing-mexican-prison-guards-easier-digging-tunnel%2F57115%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608512603/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ad0886/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608512603/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ad0886/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608512603/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ad0886/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/-3IT-69rEYY" height="1" width="1"></div><div>The Atlantic Wire<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/-b2Ph48ctHI/story01.htm>The Search for Love Offline, With a Sign</a><p> Those of you who live in Brooklyn may have noticed, over the winter, spring, and summer, signs popping up around subway stations and attached to trash cans with the romantic call to action of "Dating: One Nite Stands Only." In the fine print, along with the phone number to call if interested, there are some notes about what exactly this entails. "Dutch dating," "the library," "bookstore," "window shopping," and "a walk date" are all options. To what end, also, is clarified: "Meaning maybe romance." That's what anyone would expect from a best case scenario date, perhaps. Of course, this posted sign is something of a joke, passed around on Twitter with laughs over who exactly this guy thinks he is (a comedian, maybe?) and whether anyone has actually called (<a href="http://fortgreene.patch.com/articles/attention-ladies-lonely-clinton-hill-gent-looking-for-love">someone did! </a>We have not). But it's an old-school harkening back, however ineffectual, to a time when dating was a little more simple, or, maybe, just not on the computer.</p> <p> Online dating is now so commonplace that we need <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=why-online-dating-doesnt-work-12-02-18">scientific research to remind us that</a>, oh yes, it's not that as a form of dating it's any better at helping you find your soulmate (or just a likely companion) than the traditional varieties. It's not as if dating websites have uncovered some magic bullet of love, as much as they may purport to do so; their algorithms are algorithms but they are not perfect. What is true is that, generally, the more people you meet who are looking for a relationship or "maybe romance," the more likely you are to find one of them to your liking, and drum up something mutual. And dating websites make it easier to consider quite a lot of people, so they automate the process and make it more efficient. It's not a matter of science, it's a matter of the statistics. Eventually, if you look long enough and meet enough people, say the people who advise in such matters, it will happen. Right?</p> <p> But some people, like Mr. Maybe Romance above, are sticking with the old-school methods. For example, Adam Orna, 39, a resident of the Bronx, who hangs out in Union Square Park regularly with his own sign. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/nyregion/bronx-man-uses-please-date-me-sign-in-search-for-love.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;seid=auto">The <em>New York Times</em></a>&nbsp;has a cringeworthy-but-maybe-a-little-sweet piece on Orna, a man not unlike any number of people on the verge of 40, thinking again about what they want in life, and feeling like it's someone to share that life with. Having hit up the bar and club scenes and tried his hand at online dating (none of which worked for him), he's written his request on a sign that says, "Please Date Me." It also puts forth his qualifications: "Single, healthy, loyal, straight, marriage-minded, marathon runner, vegetarian." He's got a decently salaried job with benefits and owns a condo. So why does something about this seem so terribly sad? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/nyregion/bronx-man-uses-please-date-me-sign-in-search-for-love.html?smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;seid=auto">Alex Vadukul writes</a>,&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p itemprop="articleBody"> He sometimes wears a nice suit, sleeves rolled up, and hands out roses to women. &ldquo;Hello beautiful, care for a rose?&rdquo; is a frequent opening, as is a friendly wave accompanied by his boyish smile. Women tend to ignore his advances, but he is polite and soft-spoken, never handling rejection badly. That resilience is a good thing, for rejection tends to come in bunches.</p> </blockquote> <p itemprop="articleBody"> Perhaps it's because, as daters, we're trained to think that if someone wants something too much, it's yucky, scary, or there must be something wrong with them. Perhaps it's because we're supposed to be so cool, and anything people do publicly, online or off, to show their cards (or strategies) is likely to meet with mockery. No one wants to be a creep, and yet, <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2012/05/everything-we-do-while-dating-creepy-and-potentially-viral/52428/">we're all creepy in our own special ways!</a>&nbsp;Is it creepy to want love? No. Is it creepy to hold a sign saying that you do? Hm.</p> <p itemprop="articleBody"> Maybe, also, it's because urban-dwelling women are trained not to take roses from strangers, or to respond to their comments or requests, because that can too easily go down an uncomfortable road. But in a city in which women are always saying "there are no good men," and with a backdrop upon which we regularly bemoan men as afraid of commitment or Peter Pan syndrome-afflicted, it's rather funny, and maybe not funny <em>ha ha</em>, that a guy who comes right out and says what he wants wouldn't get any serious takers. Of course, at the same time, he's standing on the street holding a sign. Who's going to stop for that? Who's <em>not</em> going to mock it at the same time that we maybe feel a little bit bad for having done so?</p> <p itemprop="articleBody"> In fairness, though, he's really just incorporating the theory of online dating&mdash;cast the net wide, say what you want, portray yourself authentically, and don't worry about rejection&mdash;in a sort of grassroots man-on-the-street way:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p itemprop="articleBody"> At his post, Mr. Orna dutifully greeted passing women and ignored the occasional pedestrians who laughed at him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like fishing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some days you get something. Some days, nothing.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p itemprop="articleBody"> He just wants what everyone else does. Maybe romance. Or, actually, definitely romance:&nbsp;He told Vadukul, &ldquo;There have been nights I&rsquo;ve cried I was so lonely. You&rsquo;ve got a good job, good hobbies, but what good is it if there&rsquo;s no one to share it with?&rdquo; Aw/facepalm. A sign doesn't keep you warm at night, but neither does a computer <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/10/04/toasted-leg-syndrome-warning-for-laptop-users-of/">(toasted leg syndrome notwithstanding)</a>.

To little fanfare, the 33,000 troops deployed to Afghanistan as a part of President Obama's 2010 troop surge strategy have been withdrawn from the country, the Pentagon announced Friday. The move, which came a week ahead of schedule, leaves 68,000 U.S. troops remaining in the country. But "insider attacks" on NATO forces by Afghan soldiers have raised doubts about whether Afghan security forces will be ready to take over the country by 2014.&nbsp;</p> <p> As&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/world/asia/us-troop-surge-in-afghanistan-ends.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss"><em>The New York Times'&nbsp;</em>Rod Nordland</a>&nbsp;notes, the milestone went "nearly unremarked ...&nbsp;with no statement from President Hamid Karzai or the United States military commander, Gen. John R. Allen, or even from the American ambassador." For his part, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, at a press conference in New Zealand, did try to put a positive spin on the troop surge's legacy. "The surge did accomplish its objectives of reversing the Taliban momentum on the battlefield and dramatically increasing the size and capability of the Afghan national security forces," <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/09/21/last-us-surge-troops-leave-afghanistan-officials-say/">Panetta said</a>. But almost no one is taking those remarks at face value.</p> <p> As the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/09/21/last-us-surge-troops-leave-afghanistan-officials-say/">Associated Press</a>&nbsp;notes, "Panetta's success mantra ... is called into question by the decision earlier this week that, at least temporarily, NATO operations with small-sized Afghan units are no longer routine, and will require the approval of the regional commander." Such a development "called into question the core strategy that relies on NATO troops working shoulder to shoulder with Afghans, training them to take over the security of their own country so the U.S. and its allies can leave at the end of 2014 as planned," wrote the news agency.&nbsp;</p> <p> Another knock against Panetta's gloss on the withdrawal is that the Pentagon is retroactively redefining the goals of the surge. "Once it was about blunting the momentum of the Taliban. The new line is that it was about getting the Afghan military prepared to take over the country," <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/surge-justification/">writes&nbsp;<em>Wired's&nbsp;</em>Spencer Ackerman.&nbsp;</a>"The rhetorical shift is an implicit admission the surge didn&rsquo;t live up to its objectives. The surge did push insurgents out of parts of Helmand and Kandahar provinces, but it&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/06/obama-wont-use-troops-to-save-afghan-hellhole-drones-maybe/">neglected the east</a>, which&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/06/will-the-u-s-military-concede-east-afghanistan-to-the-taliban/">deteriorated</a>. Afghanistan&rsquo;s most violent districts&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/08/afghanistan-violence-helmand/">remain in the places the surge troops went</a>." In perhaps the most dispiriting stat,&nbsp;<em>The Times&nbsp;</em>notes that the level of violence is higher than it was before the surge forces came in. "In the first six months of 2012, for instance, 1,145 civilians were killed, compared with 1,267 in the same period of 2010, when surge forces were only just arriving."&nbsp;</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ac3847/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad0886/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Cbribing0Emexican0Eprison0Eguards0Eeasier0Edigging0Etunnel0C571150C/story01.htm">Bribing Mexican Prison Guards Is a Whole Lot Easier Than Digging a Tunnel</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad11e9/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Cassault0Eisrael0Eegypt0Eborder0Ekills0E10Esoldier0E30Eattackers0C571210C/story01.htm">Assault on Israel-Egypt Border Kills 1 Soldier, 3 Attackers</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ad930e/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Ctimeline0Ebenghazi0Eattacks0C571240C/story01.htm">A Timeline of the Benghazi Attacks</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23adfedd/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Canti0Eamerican0Eviolence0Epakistans0Efirst0Ecasualty0Ekfc0C571290C/story01.htm">Anti-American Violence Means No KFC for Pakistanis</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ae93b8/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Cglobal0C20A120C0A90Chillary0Eclinton0Etaking0Eshady0Eiranian0Edissident0Egroup0Eterror0Elist0C571350C/story01.htm">Hillary Clinton Is Taking a Shady Iranian Dissident Group Off the Terror List</a></li></ul></div><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=The+Troop+Surge+in+Afghanistan+Is+Officially+Over&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fglobal%2F2012%2F09%2Ftroop-surge-afghanistan-officially-over%2F57111%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=The+Troop+Surge+in+Afghanistan+Is+Officially+Over&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Fglobal%2F2012%2F09%2Ftroop-surge-afghanistan-officially-over%2F57111%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608510916/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ac3847/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608510916/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ac3847/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608510916/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ac3847/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/RH8Q9he-XjI" height="1" width="1"></div><div>The Atlantic Wire<a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~3/VBlAp-flXS0/story01.htm>iPhone 5 Is a Hot Item for Thieves</a><p> This is the year of the iPhone 5 heist, it seems, with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of phones having been reported stolen from stores across the world with thefts reported in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/story/19587738/thieves-grab-100k-worth-of-iphone-5s">Tennessee</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/BBCDomC/statuses/249122993484230656">London</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2012/09/21/burglars-in-japan-first-to-get-hands-on-iphone-5/">Osaka, Japan</a>.

The Murfreesboro police called it one of the most "systematic, brazen crimes," writes Chris Conte, for News Channel 5.&nbsp;"The entire time, mind you, the store manager was sitting in front of the store waiting to open up the store for another employee to come in," Murfreesboro's&nbsp;Sgt.

Not bad for a phone that costs $200 along with a 2-year service contract.&nbsp;</p><img width="1" height="1" src="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23ac37a4/mf.gif" border="0"><div><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23a61c7d/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Cpoor0Esmokers0Enew0Eyork0Espend0E250Etheir0Eincome0Ecigarettes0C570A940C/story01.htm">Poor Smokers in New York Spend 25% of Their Income on Cigarettes</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23a62cda/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Capple0Elines0Edead0Elong0Elive0Eapple0Eline0C570A890C/story01.htm">The Apple Line's Dead, Long Live the Apple Line!</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23a6be39/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Cwell0Efinds0Eappropriate0Ebuyer0C5710A20C/story01.htm">The WELL Finds an Appropriate Buyer</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23acd6c3/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Cfacebook0Erealizes0Enobody0Ewants0Eshare0Eeverything0Eall0Etime0C5710A90C/story01.htm">Frictionless Sharing Hits the Skids at Facebook</a></li><li><a href="http://theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625848/s/23aed169/l/0L0Stheatlanticwire0N0Ctechnology0C20A120C0A90Ceverything0Eyou0Eneed0Eknow0Eabout0Ewhy0Eapple0Emaps0Eproblem0Eisnt0Egoing0Eaway0Esoon0C571270C/story01.htm">Everything You Need to Know About Why Apple Maps Problem Isn't Going Away Soon</a></li></ul></div><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=iPhone+5+Is+a+Hot+Item+for+Thieves&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Ftechnology%2F2012%2F09%2Fiphone-5s-are-hot-item-thieves%2F57110%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" border="0"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=iPhone+5+Is+a+Hot+Item+for+Thieves&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlanticwire.com%2Ftechnology%2F2012%2F09%2Fiphone-5s-are-hot-item-thieves%2F57110%2F" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr></table></div><br><br><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608510820/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ac37a4/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/145608510820/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ac37a4/a2.img" border="0"></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/145608510820/u/49/f/625848/c/34375/s/23ac37a4/a2t.img" border="0"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlanticWire/~4/VBlAp-flXS0" height="1" width="1"></div>

<b>Tell us your name, age, profession and what you typically wear every day.</b></div>
<div>
Hello! My name is Dijana Rajkovic, I'm a kindergarten teacher. I usually wear comfy clothes for the job, you know how it is working with kids, it always gets messy. Most of the time I'm in pants in various colors, jeans and tops, worn with oxfords, sandals and wedges. When I'm not working you can see me in dresses and skirts. I love accessorizing with big rings like knuckle rings and statement necklaces. I love colors, especially neons, but earthy colors suit me the best and I love to wear them.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b>Where do you live, and what trends are big there?</b></div>
<div>
I live in Croatia, it's in Central and Southeast Europe, in the capital city Zagreb. The trend here is Converse sneakers, especially in white, colorful maxi skirts and maxi and midi dresses. I like all of the colors I see here, from neon to pastels.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b>What is your favorite brand/designer? What do like about that brand?</b></div>
<div>
One of my favorite brands is 3.1 Phillip Lim because of his clean-cut silhouettes and lovely color palettes. I like Burberry Prorsum because the designer, Christopher Bailey, knows how to shape a perfect jacket and coat. He's re-invented trenches. Givenchy, oh my! The creative director, Riccardo Tisci, is amazing! He amazes me every time, combining Gothic and streetwear elements with the refinement of haute couture. Fantastic! Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel, he is so original. I love his fashion shows. Every time, he does something new. His play with monochromatic and pastel colors make a great mix in tweed jackets. &nbsp;I like Valentino because he knows how to dress a woman. His dresses are elegant, clean, simple, modern, feminine, sophisticated and glamorous. &nbsp;Finally, Alexander McQueen. I love his raw and emotional passion for fashion. He brought drama and extravagance to the catwalk, and Sarah Burton continues his work brilliantly!&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
Among Croatian designers, I like Aleksandra Dojcinovic. She creates beautiful, feminine dresses that follow women's curves. I also like Zigman, who is always playful and quirky with his designs. I can't afford these designers, so I stick mostly with highstreet brands like Mango, H&amp;M, Promod, Zara, Pull &amp; Bear and Stradivarius.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b>Which celebrity has great style? What do you like about his or her style?</b></div>
<div>
I love Olivia Palermo and Jessica Alba. Olivia is always chic and feminine. Jessica always looks gorgeous in casual and glamorous styles. I'm also inspired by Russian women like&nbsp;Elena Perminova, Ulyana Sergeenko, Miroslava Duma and Vika Gazinskaya. Their fashions are unique.</div>
<div>
<b><br></b></div>
<div>
<b>What are your personal aspirations/goals?</b></div>
<div>
Someday, I would like to start a blog. I know, haha, another fashion blog. I want it to be about my look. I'm not good at taking pictures of myself though, so first, I will have to find someone to take photos of me. I could see myself one day in fashion magazines, making fashion collages like I do on Polyvore. That's my dream. Currently, I'm using my&nbsp;creativity&nbsp;making toys and games for kids.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b>How has Polyvore affected your life?</b></div>
<div>
I remember when a friend recommended this site four years ago, I gave it a try, and I loved it! I used to wear more sporty, urban clothes like jeans, t-shirts and high-top sneakers. I was a hip-hop girl. Polyvore quickly changed my views on fashion. It changed my style to something more grown-up and mature. I started to wear heels, dresses, skirts, and totally fell in love with wedges. I'm petite girl (5'2") so wedges are great for defining my legs. I get inspired by street fashion. Polyvore gives me a daily dose of different fashion ideas/styles! It is also a wonderful relief from my stressful job. I 'm the still same hip-hop girl, but with different taste in clothes.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b>How would you describe your set style?</b></div>
<div>
I don't have any specific set style. I change my layouts depending on the clothes, pictures and mood. I love big sets. I always add a few magazine articles and pictures, but make sure to leave room for the clothes. They're the most important part! The pictures in the set have to match the clothes to round out the story. I always use background colors like colorful stripes. They have to be similar in color to the clothes. I really try to make my sets look different and neat. It's still a challenge to distinguish my sets from other fantastic sets and styles.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b>How often do you sign on and what is the first thing you do when you sign on?</b></div>
<div>
Haha! I'm always signed in, Polyvore is bookmarked at the top of my list. When I'm online, I have a few tabs open so I'm always jumping from one to another. The first thing I do when I go on to Polyvore is check my activity, then my friends' sets and comments, then I like their sets. After all of that, I create sets. I'd love a mobile version too!</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b>Describe your personal sense of style.</b></div>
<div>
My personal sense of style is casual and feminine. I love to mix up prints and colors. I usually take bits and pieces from different trends and play with them. I follow my instincts and my daily mood, and I never leave the house without a smile.</div>
